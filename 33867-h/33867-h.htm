<span class="smlfont">LIVETTE AND ZINZARA</span></h2>


<p>A shadow suddenly darkened the narrow window.
Livette, who was running hither and thither, setting the
table for supper, in the lower room of the farm-house of
the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon, gave a little shriek of terror,
and looked up.</p>

<p>The girl had an instinctive feeling that it was neither
father nor grandmother, nor any of her dear ones, but
some stranger, who sought amusement by thus taking
her by surprise.</p>

<p>Nor a stranger, either, for that matter,&mdash;it was hardly
possible!&mdash;But how was it that the dogs did not yelp?
Ah! this Camargue is frequented by bad people, especially
at this season, toward the end of May, on account
of the festival of Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, which attracts,
like a fair, such a crowd of people, thieves and
gulls, and so many mischievous gipsies!</p>

<p>The figure that was leaning on the outside of the
window-sill, shutting out the light, looked to Livette
like a black mass, sharply outlined against the blue sky;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
but by the thick, curly hair, surmounted by a tinsel
crown, by the general contour of the bust, by the huge
ear-rings with an amulet hanging at the ends, Livette
recognized a certain gipsy woman who was universally
known as the Queen, and who, for nearly two weeks,
had been suddenly appearing to people at widely distant
points on the island, always unexpectedly, as if she rose
out of the ditches or clumps of thorn-broom or the
water of the swamps, to say to the laborers, preferably
the women: &ldquo;Give me this or that;&rdquo; for the Queen,
as a general rule, would not accept what people chose to
offer her, but only what she chose that they should offer
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me a little oil in a bottle, Livette,&rdquo; said
the young gipsy, darting a dark, flashing glance at the
pretty girl with the fair, sun-flecked hair.</p>

<p>Livette, charitable as she was at every opportunity, at
once felt that she must be on her guard against this
vagabond, who knew her name. Her father and grandmother
had gone to Arles, to see the notary, who would
soon have to be drawing up the papers for her marriage
to Renaud, the handsomest drover in all Camargue.
She was alone in the house. Distrust gave her strength
to refuse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our Camargue isn&rsquo;t an olive country,&rdquo; said she
curtly, &ldquo;oil is scarce here. I haven&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I see some in the jar at the bottom of the
cupboard, beside the water-pitcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
Livette turned hastily toward the cupboard. It was
closed; but, in truth, the stock of olive oil was there in
a jar beside the one in which they kept Rh&ocirc;ne water for
their daily needs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; said Livette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lie came from your mouth like a vile black
wasp from a garden-flower, little one!&rdquo; said the motionless
figure, still leaning heavily on the window-sill,
evidently determined to remain. &ldquo;The oil is where I
say it is, and more than twenty-five litres too; I can see
it from here. Come, come, take a clean bottle and the
tin funnel and give me quickly what I want. I&rsquo;ll tell
you, in exchange, what I see in your future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a deadly sin to seek to know what God doesn&rsquo;t
wish us to know,&rdquo; said Livette, &ldquo;and you can guess
that oil is kept in cupboards and still be no more of a
sorceress than I am. Go about your business, good-wife.
I can give you some of this bread, fresh baked
last night, if you wish, but I tell you I haven&rsquo;t any
oil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why do they call you Livette,&rdquo; said the Queen
calmly, &ldquo;if it isn&rsquo;t on account of the field of old olive-trees&mdash;the
oldest and finest in the country&mdash;owned by
your father, near Avignon? There you were born.
There you remained until you were ten years old, and at
that age&mdash;seven years ago, a mystic number&mdash;you came
here, where your father was made farmer, overseer
of drovers, manager of everything, by the Avignonese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
master of this &lsquo;Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon,&rsquo; the finest in all
Camargue.&mdash;&lsquo;Livettes! livettes!&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the way you
used to ask for <i>olivettes</i>, olives, when you were a
baby. You were very fond of them, and the nickname
clung to you. A pretty nickname, on my word,
and one that suits you well, for if you&rsquo;re not dark
like the ripe olive, you&rsquo;re fair as the virgin oil, a
pearl of amber in the sunlight, and then you are not
yet ripe. Your face is oval, and not stupidly round like
a Norman apple. You have the pallor of the olive-leaves
seen from below.&mdash;And that you may soon see them so,
little one, is the blessing I ask for you, as the cur&eacute;s of
your chapels say, where they take us in for pity. Be
compassionate as they are, in the name of your Lord
Jesus Christ, and give me some oil quickly, I say&mdash;in the
name of extreme unction and the garden of agony!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gipsy had said all this without stopping to breathe,
in a dull, monotonous, muffled voice, but she added abruptly
in loud, piercing, incisive tones: &ldquo;Do you understand
what I say?&rdquo; imparting to those simple words an
extraordinarily imperious and violent expression. Livette
hastily crossed herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, enough of this!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I have nothing
here for you, and we keep the oil of extreme unction for
better Christians! Begone, pagan, begone!&rdquo; she added,
trying to counterfeit courage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the three holy women,&rdquo; continued the gipsy,
&ldquo;who took ship, after the death of Jesus Christ, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
escape the crucifying Jews, one was like myself, an
Egyptian and a fortune-teller. She knew the science
of the Magi, of those with whom great Moses contended
for mastery in witchcraft. She could, at will,
order the frogs to be more numerous than the drops of
water in the swamps, and she held in her hand a rod
which, at her word, would change to a viper. Before
Jesus she bowed, as did Magdalen, and Jesus loved her
too. In the tempest, as they were crossing the sea,
her wand pointed out the course to follow, and, to do
that with safety, had no need to be very long. Must
you have more pledges of my power and my knowledge?
What more must I tell you to induce you to give me the
oil I need so much? If you were a man, I would say:
&lsquo;Look! I am dark, but I am beautiful! I am a descendant
of that Sara the Egyptian who, when the boat
of the three holy women drew near the sands of Camargue,
paid the boatman by showing him her undefiled
body, stripped naked, with no thought of evil and without
sin, but knowing well that true beauty is rare and
that the mere sight of it is better than all the treasures
of Solomon. So be it!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Livette was thoroughly alarmed. The gipsy&rsquo;s assurance,
her hollow, penetrating voice, imperious by fits
and starts, these strange tales filled with evil words on
sacred subjects, this devilish mixture of things pagan
and things mystic, the consciousness of her own loneliness,
all combined to terrify her. She lost her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
&ldquo;Away with you, away with you,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;queen
of robbers! queen of brigands! away with you, or I will
call for help!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your drover won&rsquo;t hear you; he&rsquo;s tending his drove
to-day beside the Vaccar&egrave;s. Come, give me the oil, I
say, or I&rsquo;ll throw this black wand on the ground, and
you will see how snakes bite!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Livette, brave and determined, said: &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
shuddering as she said it, and, to glean a little comfort,
cast a glance at the low beam along which her father&rsquo;s
gun was hanging. The gipsy saw the glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I am not afraid of your gun,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and
to prove it&mdash;wait a moment!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She left the window. The light streamed into the room,
bringing a little courage to Livette&rsquo;s terrified heart, as
she followed the gipsy with her eyes. In the bright
light of that beautiful May evening, the gipsy woman
stood out, a tall figure, against the distant, unbroken
horizon line of the Camargue desert, which could be
seen through a vista between the lofty trees of the park.</p>

<p>Livette felt a thrill of joy as she saw a troop of mares
trotting along the horizon, followed by their driver,
spear in air&mdash;Jacques Renaud, her fianc&eacute;, without
doubt.&mdash;But how far away he was! the horses, from
where she stood, looked smaller than a flock of little
goats. And her eyes came back to the gipsy queen.
A few steps from the farm-house, in front of the seigniorial
ch&acirc;teau, a huge square structure, with numerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
windows, long closed,&mdash;a structure of the sort that
arouses thoughts of neglect and death and the grave,&mdash;the
gipsy stood on tiptoe, drawing down the lowest
branch of a thorn-tree. The thorns were long, as long
as one&rsquo;s finger. With a twig of a tree of that species
the crown of the Crucified One was made.</p>

<p>She broke off a twig thickset with thorns, bent it into
a circle, twisting the two ends together like serpents, and
returned to the window.</p>

<p>Livette noticed at that moment that the two watch-dogs
were following the gipsy, with their tails between
their legs, their noses close to her heels, with little
affectionate whines. And she, the gipsy Queen, as
slender as haughty, erect upon her legs, in a ragged
skirt with ample folds through the holes in which could
be seen a bright red petticoat, her bust enveloped in
orange-colored rags crossed below her well-rounded
breasts, her amulets tinkling at her ears, medallions
jangling on her forehead, which was encircled by a gaudy
fillet of copper,&mdash;she, the Queen, came forward, holding
in her hand the crown of long stiff thorns, to which
a few tiny green leaves clung in quivering festoons;&mdash;and
in a low, very low tone, she murmured the same
caressing plaint that the two great cowed dogs were
murmuring, saying to them, in their own language,
mysterious things they understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take this,&rdquo; said the gipsy, &ldquo;let your kind heart
be rewarded as it deserves! Misfortune, which is at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
work for you, will soon make itself known to you. How,
may God tell you! In love, the wind that blows for
you is poisoned by the swamps. The charity your
God enjoins is, so they say, another form of love that
brings true love good fortune. And here is my queenly
gift!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She threw the crown of thorns through the window at
Livette&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame!&rdquo; exclaimed Livette in dismay.</p>

<p>But the gipsy had disappeared.</p>

<p>Infinite distress filled the poor child&rsquo;s heart. With
her eyes fixed on the crown, Livette recalled the legends
in which the good Lord Jesus appears disguised as a
beggar&mdash;and in which He rewards those who have received
Him with sweet compassion.</p>

<p>In one of those legends, the Poor Man, welcomed
with harsh words, subjected to mockery and cowardly
insults, struck with staves and goblets and bottles thrown
by drunken revellers&mdash;at last, standing against the wall,
begins to be transformed into a Christ upon the Cross,
bleeding at the holes in his hands and feet!&mdash;And, sick
with terror, she asked herself if she had not received
with unkindness one of the three holy women who, after
the death of Jesus, crossed the sea in a boat to the
shores of Camargue, using their skirts for sails, and
assisted by the oars of a boatman, whom one of their
number, Sara the Egyptian, paid in heathen coin, by
allowing him to see, as the price of a Christian action,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
her undefiled body, entirely naked, upon the self-same
spot on which the church stands to-day.</p>

<p>Slowly she picked up the crown and threw it into the
fire over which the soup was stewing. Before it melted
into ashes, the crown of thorns seemed for a moment to
be pure gold.</p>

<h2><a name="chap02" id="chap02"></a>II<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">IN CAMARGUE</span></h2>


<p>Every year, at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, the village
that stands at the southern end of Camargue, above the
marshes, on a sand beach, the line of which is constantly
changed by the action of the waves and high
winds, every year, the feast of Saintes-Maries is celebrated
on May 24th; and at the time of that festival
the gipsies flock to Camargue in large numbers, impelled
by a curious sort of piety, mingled with a desire
to pilfer the pilgrims.</p>

<p>Legends, like trees, spring from the soil,&mdash;are its
expression, so to speak. They are also its essence. At
every step in Camargue, you find the everlasting legend
of the holy women, just as you everlastingly see there
the same tamarisk-trees, confused, against the horizon,
with the same mirages.</p>

<p>The two Marys, so runs the legend, Jacob&eacute;, Salom&eacute;,
and&mdash;according to some authorities&mdash;Magdalen, and
with them their bondwomen, Marcella and Sara, adrift
on the sea in a boat without masts or sails, pursued by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
the accursed Jews, after the Saviour&rsquo;s death, spread
to the breeze strips of their skirts and their long, thin
veils, and the wind carried them to this beach at
Camargue.</p>

<p>There a church was built. The sacred bones, found
by King Ren&eacute;, were enclosed in a reliquary, which has
never ceased to perform miracles. And every year,
from every corner of Provence, from the Comtat and
from Languedoc, the last of the believers throng to the
spot, bringing their aspirations and their prayers, dragging
with them their sick friends and kindred, or their
own wretchedness, their wounds and their lamentations.</p>

<p>Nothing more strange can be imagined than this land
of desolation, traversed every year by a multitude of
cripples on their way to hope!</p>

<p>From afar, at the end of the desert tract, can be seen
the battlemented church that tells of the wars of long
ago, of Saracen invasions, of the precarious life led by
the poor in the Middle Ages. It stands there with its
turrets and its bell-tower, which, like the stumps of
gigantic masts, tower above the cluster of houses grouped
about it; and the village, cut at about mid-height of
the lower houses by the horizon line of the sea, seems
drifting like a phantom ship among the billows of sand,
like the boat of the holy women of the olden time,
doomed to founder at last in the desolation of the desert.</p>

<p>In this Camargue everything is strange. There are
ponds like the huge central pond, the Vaccar&egrave;s, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
centre of which one can wade with ease; there are tracts
of land where the pedestrian sinks out of sight and is
drowned. Here deception is easy. Yonder green slime
that you take for a level plain&mdash;beware!&mdash;men are
drowned therein; those vast stretches of water which
seem to you small seas&mdash;return that way to-morrow;
they will have evaporated, leaving only a mirror of white
salt that crackles beneath your feet. Yonder, do you see
the calm, deep water? and trees on the shore? Ah! no,
you can run along the surface of that water; it is dry
land; the mirage alone formed those trees, just as it
showed you the little child walking a league away,
apparently near at hand and very tall. A land of
visions, dreams, and hard work. A land of sedentary
folk, who inhabit a vast space on the shore of endless
waters, with an infinity of variations of mirages, sunbeams,
reflections, and bright colors. A land of fever,
where strong men daily bring wild bulls to earth. A
land of leave-takings, for it is on the confines of an
almost uninhabited land, on the shore of that great blue
and white thoroughfare, the sea; just at the point where
the Rh&ocirc;ne, coming from the mountains, sets out upon
its long journey to the bottomless waters, where the sun
will take it up again to restore it to its source. An impressive
land, which one feels to be the end of so many
things; of the great city-making river, of the great
expiring Faith, which flies to the sands to breathe its
last, with its dying waves beating at the foundations of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
poor battlemented church, amid the psalms, mingled
with lamentations of a dying race.</p>

<p>The ceremony of May 24th, at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer,
is unquestionably one of the most barbarous spectacles
which men of modern times are permitted to
witness.</p>

<p>Since science made the conquest of men&rsquo;s minds, the
faith of the last believers has changed. The most bigoted
know, of course, that God can manifest Himself when
and how He pleases, but they also know that He never
pleases, in our positive days, to modify the movements
of the vast mechanism of His creation, not even for the
lowly pleasure of proving His existence to His creatures.
The faith of civilized men no longer expects anything
from Heaven in this world.</p>

<p>Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, on the 24th of May, is the
rendezvous of the last savages of the Faith.</p>

<p>They who come to pray to the holy women for health
of body and of heart are unpolished creatures of a
primitive belief. They believe, and that is the whole of
it. A cry, a prayer, and, in reply, the saints can give
them what they have not: eyes, legs, arms, life! And
they ask them to perform a miracle as artlessly as a condemned
man implores his pardon from the head of the
State. That their prayers should be granted is quite as
possible, almost more probable, for the saints have more
pity. The few thousands of believers&mdash;it is long since
their numbers have been added to&mdash;who pay a visit to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
the saints every year, see one or two miracles on each
occasion. When the priest, coming from the church,
followed by a procession, stretches out toward the sea
the <em>Silver Arm</em> which contains the relics, they see the
sea recede! That happens every year. Imagine, then,
how strenuously they importune the saints who can do
so much with so little exertion! with what energy they
hurry to the spot! with what sighs they pour out their
hearts! with what a howling they utter their prayers!
with what fervor they raise their eyes, stretch out their
necks and their arms! All, all in vain. The last posturings
of the great, fruitlessly imploring sorrow are to
be seen there, in that desert corner of France, between
the arms of that dying stream, on the shore of the sea
that is eating away the island; beneath the arches
of yonder church, so white without, so black within,
wherein every hand holds a taper, flickering like a star
of human misery, which burns for God and greases the
fingers, and for which the beggar, whose heart would be
made glad by a single sou, must pay five sous.</p>

<p>The whole region seems to be at once the highway to
exile, and a wild place of refuge. Therefore, the gipsies
love it. It is one of the main cross-roads of their interlacing
highways which envelop the whole world; it is
one of the favorite countries of the race that has no
country.</p>

<p>And every year, the gipsies come to Camargue to
enjoy their very ancient privilege of occupying a black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
crypt or underground chapel, under the choir of the
church, consecrated to Saint Sara the Egyptian.</p>

<p>In that cavern they can be seen crouching at the foot
of an altar whereon is a little shrine&mdash;Saint Sara&rsquo;s&mdash;all
filthy from much kissing, while above, in the church, the
great shrines of the two Marys are lowered from the
vaulted roof amid vociferous prayers.</p>

<p>There, in the crypt, the gipsies sit upon their haunches,
curly-headed, hot-lipped, sweating profusely, amid hundreds
of candles, which exude tallow and overheat the
stifling oven, telling their greasy beads, exhaling an
odor similar to that of wild beasts in their den, emitting
from time to time a hoarse appeal to Saint Sara,
wearing the smile of premeditated crime upon their
faces mingled with the grimace due to remorse that
may be sincere; looking with envious eye at every
sou, pilfering handkerchiefs, scratching their wounds,
swarming in a mysterious dunghill, where one feels, in
spite of everything, that some mystic flower is springing
into life, the involuntary aspiration of depravity
toward purity.</p>

<p>Early in May of this year, the band of gipsies had
brought with them to the saints a young woman whom
they called their &ldquo;Queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This &ldquo;Queen,&rdquo; pending the arrival of the approaching
f&ecirc;te-day, passed part of her time seated on the
wooden bench under the canopy of thorn-broom erected
by the customs&rsquo; officers between two tamarisks, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
sand-dune just in front of the village; and there she sat
and gazed at the sea.</p>

<p>Her name was Zinzara.</p>

<p>Her thick, black, wavy hair was twisted carelessly
into a mass on top of her head. Two locks came forward
to her temples, which were sunken and filled with
shadows. Her piercing black eyes gleamed from beneath
her thick arching eyebrows. A copper circlet with
sequins hanging from it was placed upon her forehead,
slightly at one side, after the manner of a crown.</p>

<p>The glaringly bright materials in which she enveloped
her figure revealed the outline of her powerful chest,
and her hips that swayed at every step she took. And
the fragment that formed her skirt fell in graceful
folds, beneath which her naked foot peeped out, glistening
with sand.</p>

<p>Evening surprised her upon her bench beneath the
broom, looking out upon the sea. The sun tinged the
waves and the sand with golden yellow, then with red.
The night wind made the reeds and rushes quiver.
Slowly the gipsy drew a bright-colored handkerchief
from her girdle and arranged it on her head. She put
it over her face to tie the ends together behind the mass
of hair, then raised it and threw it over her head, so
that it fell upon her back. Thus arranged as a head-dress,
it framed the face in stiff, broad folds, falling on
both sides,&mdash;and the Egyptian, her hands spread out
upon her knees, her eyes fixed on the horizon, resembled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
some figure of Isis, while about her a flock of red
flamingoes or a solitary ibis, in hieroglyphic cries, told
the sands of Camargue and the rushes of the Rh&ocirc;ne
tales of the sands of Libya and the lotus-trees of the
Nile.</p>

<h2><a name="chap03" id="chap03"></a>III<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE DROVERS</span></h2>


<p>Jacques Renaud, Livette&rsquo;s lover, was employed as
drover of bulls and horses in this strange Camargue
country, on the estate of the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon.</p>

<p>The <i>manades</i>, or droves, of Camargue bulls and
mares live at liberty in the vast moor, leaping the
ditches, splashing through the swamps, browsing on the
bitter grass, drinking from the Rh&ocirc;ne, running, jumping,
wallowing, neighing and lowing at the sun or the
mirage, lashing vigorously with their tails the swarms
of gadflies clinging to their sides, then lying down in
groups on the edge of the swamp, knees doubled under
their bulky bodies, tired and sleepy, their dreamy eyes
fixed vaguely on the horizon.</p>

<p>The mounted drovers leave them at liberty, but keep
a watchful eye on their freedom; and according to the
time of year and the condition of the pasturage, &ldquo;round
up&rdquo; their herds, keep them together, and direct their
movements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
In the distance, as they sit motionless, and straight as
arrows, on their saddles <i>&agrave; la gardiane</i>, astride their white
horses, with the spear-head resting on the closed stirrup,
they resemble knights of the Middle Ages, awaiting the
flourish of the herald&rsquo;s trumpet to enter the lists.</p>

<p>The Camargue horse, with his powerful hind-quarters,
stout shoulders, head a little heavy,&mdash;an excellent beast
withal,&mdash;is descended from Saracen mares and the palfrey
of the Crusades. He still wears antique trappings. Huge
closed stirrups strike against his sides; the broad strap
of the martingale passes through a heart-shaped piece of
leather on his chest, and the saddle is an easy-chair,
wherein the rider sits between two solid walls, the one
in front as high as that at his back.</p>

<p>At certain times, when the best pasturage is on the
other bank of the Rh&ocirc;ne, the drovers drive their
<i>manades</i> toward the river. When they reach the shore,
they press close upon them to force them in. The
earth-colored water of the river flows bubbling by.
The beasts hesitate. Some slowly put their heads down
to the stream and drink, not knowing what is required
of them. Others suddenly show signs of life at the
&ldquo;singing&rdquo; of the water, stretch their necks, breathe
noisily, and low and neigh. A horse, urged forward by
a drover, rebels and rushes back, then rears and falls
backward into the water, which splashes mightily under
the weight of his great body; but he has made a start;
he swims, and all the others follow. Muzzles and nostrils,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
manes and horns, wave wildly about above the river,
which is now a swarm of heads. They blow foam and
air and water all around. More than one, in jovial
mood, bites at a neighboring rump. Feet rise upon
backs, to be shaken off again with a quick movement
of the spinal column, and thrown back into the waves.
Sometimes a frightened beast, confused by the plunging
and kicking, tries to return to the bank, and, being
driven in once more by the drovers, loses his head,
follows the current, sails swiftly seaward, feels his
strength failing, drinks, struggles, turns over and over,
plunges, drinks again, founders at last like a vessel and
disappears.</p>

<p>Finally the bulk of the drove has reached the opposite
bank, and there they shake themselves in the sunlight,
snort with delight, and caper over the fields. Tails lash
sides and buttocks. Some young horses, excited by their
bath, scamper away, side by side, toward the horizon,
biting at the long hairs of each other&rsquo;s flying manes.</p>

<p>Then it is the turn of the drovers. Some ride their
horses into the river. Others, in the midst of the rearguard
of the <i>manade</i>, guide, with the paddle, a flat-bottomed
boat that a blow of the foot would shatter,
and their horses, held by their bridles, swim behind.</p>

<p>At other times, the drovers are employed driving from
the plains of Meyran or Arles, Avignon, N&icirc;mes, Aigues-Mortes
to the branding-places at Camargue the bulls
that are to take part in the sports at the latter place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
These bulls sometimes travel in captivity, in a sort of
high enclosure, without a floor, mounted on wheels and
drawn by horses; the bulls walk along the ground, beating
their horns against the resonant wooden walls.</p>

<p>Generally the bulls go to the games unconfined, but
under the eye of mounted drovers, spear in hand.</p>

<p>These journeys are made at night. As they pass
through the villages, the people rush to their windows.
The young men are on the watch for the &ldquo;cattle&rdquo; and
try to drive them out of the circle of drovers, who lose
their temper, and swear and strike: that sport is called
the <i>abrivade</i>. In Arles, if the bulls happen to arrive by
daylight, the drovers have a hard task, for all the young
men in the city do their utmost to break the line of
horsemen, in order to cut out one bull, or several, if
possible, and then drive them through the city. The
city assumes a posture of defence. Overturned carts
barricade the ends of the streets. Shops are closed.
The bull, in a frenzy, rushes here and there, stands
musing for a moment at the corners, decides to take a certain
direction, rushes at a passer-by, knocks him down,
and generally selects the shop of a dealer in crockery and
glassware in which to make merry, amid the shouts of an
excited populace.</p>

<p>The drovers are a free, fearless, savage race, a little
contemptuous of cities, devoted to their desert.</p>

<p>A drover is at home alike in sun and rain, in the wind
from the land, and the wind from the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
A drover knows how to deal blows and to receive
them; he pursues a bull at the gallop, and with a blow
of the spear upon his flank, judiciously selecting his time,
&ldquo;fells&rdquo; him unerringly.</p>

<p>He knows the trick of pursuing a wild bull making
for the open country. His well-trained horse bites the
furious beast on the hind-quarters, and he turns. The
drover, spear in rest, pricks the bull in the nose as he
rushes upon him, and checks him.</p>

<p>Sometimes a drover, on foot and alone, pursued by a
cow with calf, and apparently in imminent danger from
the furious beast, will suddenly turn about, and&mdash;with
arm outstretched, as if he held his spear&mdash;point his three
fingers at the animal, separated so as to represent the
three points of the trident. In face of the motionless
man, the cow, seized with terror, recoils, pawing up the
earth, with lowered head and threatening horns; and, as
soon as she thinks she is well out of the man&rsquo;s reach, she
turns and flies.</p>

<p>A common performance of the drover, when he is in
good spirits, is this: pursuing the bull, he passes beyond
him some twenty or thirty yards, then stops short and
leaps down from his horse; the bull, taken by surprise,
rushes at the man, who has one knee on the ground.
The bull comes rushing on with lowered horns. Three
sharp hand-claps: the bull has stopped! His hot breath
strikes the face of his subduer, who has already seized
him with both hands by the horns. The man, springing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
instantly to his feet, struggles to throw the beast over to
the right. The bull, resisting, throws himself in the
opposite direction. The two forces neutralize each
other for an instant, almost equal, the result uncertain;
then the man suddenly yields, and the beast, unexpectedly
impelled in the direction of his own efforts,
falls upon his side. Skill is seconded by the creature&rsquo;s
whole strength in its struggle for victory.</p>

<p>This is the method adopted at the <i>ferrades</i>, or brandings,
where the sport consists in branding the young
animals with a red-hot iron.</p>

<p>For a drover, to seize a colt by the nose, and mount
him bareback; to roll with his steed at the bottom of a
ditch and emerge firmly seated in the saddle; to subdue
stallions by fatigue, and, if dismounted and wounded by
a kick, to dress the wound as tranquilly as the cork-cutter
dresses the scratch made by his knife,&mdash;all this is mere
child&rsquo;s-play.</p>

<p>A drover, caught between two horns&mdash;luckily well
separated&mdash;and tossed into the air, has but one thought
when he picks himself up after falling to the ground&mdash;a
thought so surprising as not to be ridiculous: to rearrange
his breeches and readjust his belt.</p>

<p>A unique race it is, rough and brutal, which would be
esteemed heroic, like the Corsican race, if it had great
affairs in which to display its great qualities.</p>

<h2><a name="chap04" id="chap04"></a>IV<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE S&Eacute;DEN</span></h2>


<p>Jacques Renaud, Livette&rsquo;s betrothed, was, as we have
said, one of the most fearless drovers in Camargue.</p>

<p>He could pursue and catch and subdue a wild horse,
attack a rebellious bull and master it, as no other could;
he was the king of the moor.</p>

<p>For occasions of public rejoicing, at N&icirc;mes or Arles,
he was always sent for when they desired a really fine
performance in the arena. And he had so often called
forth the exclamation, in all the arenas throughout
Provence: &ldquo;Oh! that fellow is <em>the king</em> of them all!&rdquo;
that the name had clung to him. And he himself had
given to his finest stallion the name of &ldquo;Prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whatever feats of address and strength were performed
by others, he performed better than they.</p>

<p>And with it all he was a handsome fellow, not too tall
or too short, with a well-shaped head, clear, dark complexion,
short, thick, matted black hair, a well-defined
moustache of the same devil&rsquo;s black as the hair, and
cheeks and chin always closely shaven, for this savage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
always carried in the leather saddle-bags hanging at the
bow of his saddle a razor-edged knife, a stone to sharpen
it upon, and a little round mirror in a sheep-skin case.</p>

<p>And when, with his stout and shapely legs encased in
heavy boots, his feet in the closed stirrups, his long
spear resting on his boot, he sat erect and motionless in
his high-backed saddle, his size heightened by the refraction
of the desert, amid his little tribe of mares and
wild bulls, wearing upon his head the round narrow-brimmed
hat that made for him a crown of gleaming
golden straw, indeed the drover did resemble the king
of some outlandish race!</p>

<p>And yet it was not on the day of a <i>ferrade</i>, nor because
of his great deeds as tamer of wild beasts, that
the gentle, fair-haired girl had come to love him.</p>

<p>In the first place, she was accustomed to seeing many
of these drovers; and then, being the daughter of a rich
intendant, she might have been inclined rather to look
down upon them a little, as mere herdsmen. Indeed
her father and grandmother did not readily agree to
give her hand to Renaud, who was poor and had no
kindred; but Livette was an only child, and had wept
and prayed so hard, the darling, that at last they had
said <em>yes</em>.</p>

<p>And this is how it came to pass that the drover
Renaud, who was used to being run after by pretty
girls, had taken Livette&rsquo;s trembling little heart in his
great hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
It was one morning when he was making a new <i>s&eacute;den</i>
for his horse, who had lost his the night before, while
bathing in the Rh&ocirc;ne.</p>

<p>The <i>s&eacute;den</i>, as it is called in Camargue, is a halter,
but a halter made of mares&rsquo; hair braided, it being customary
always to allow the manes and tails of stallions
to grow as long as they will, as a mark of strength and
pride. The <i>s&eacute;den</i> is generally black and white. It is,
in a word, a long rope, which hangs in a coil about the
horse&rsquo;s neck, and may serve, as occasion arises, many
purposes, being generally used as a halter, sometimes as
a lasso.</p>

<p>But the <i>s&eacute;den</i>, being a thing essentially Camarguese,
should never go from the province. Many a one does
so, no doubt, but it is on account of the contemptible
greed of this or that drover, who snaps his fingers at the
old customs that were good enough for his ancestors.</p>

<p>Renaud, then, was making a <i>s&eacute;den</i>. It was in front
of one of the farm-houses appertaining to the Ch&acirc;teau
d&rsquo;Avignon, a long, low structure, rather a drover&rsquo;s
cottage than a farm-house, lost in the moor, and so
squat that it had the appearance of not wanting to be
seen, like an animal burrowing in the ground.</p>

<p>It was October. The larks were singing merrily.
Mounted upon Blanquet (or Blanchet), her favorite
horse, the little one, in obedience to her father&rsquo;s
orders, was out in search of Renaud, and she spied him
at a distance, walking backward, playing the rope-maker.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
From a piece of canvas tied around his waist and swelling
out in front of him, like an apron turned up to
make a great pocket, he was taking little bunches of
white and black hair alternately, braiding them together
and twisting them into a rope, which grew visibly
longer. A child was turning the thick wooden wheel
upon which the <i>s&eacute;den</i>, already of considerable length,
was wound; and Renaud&mdash;keeping time to the wheel,
which struck a dull blow against something or other at
every revolution&mdash;was singing a ballad which floated to
Livette&rsquo;s ears on the gentle breeze that was blowing, like
a sweet, strong call from the love of which she as yet
knew nothing.</p>

<p>Livette had stopped her horse, to hear better. It was
in the morning. In the light there was the reflection
that tells that the day is young, that makes hope dance
in hearts of sixteen, and sows hope anew even in the
hearts of the old.</p>

<p>A vague hope that is naught but the desire to love;
but its loss, bitterer than death, makes the thought of
death a consolation!</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p>the singer repeated, and the little one involuntarily urged
her horse toward the song that called to her to come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said Renaud, pausing in his work, &ldquo;aha!
young lady! you are astir early!&mdash;with a white horse
that will soon be all red!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, laughing, &ldquo;with gnats and gadflies;
there are swarms of them! too many, by my faith in
God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are covered with them, young lady, as a bit
of honey is covered with bees, or a tuft of flowering
genesta! But what brings you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I come from my father. You must come with me
at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
&ldquo;But comrade Rampal borrowed my horse just now
to go to Saintes. They went off one upon the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take mine, then,&rdquo; said Livette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what will you do, young lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was ashamed of her thoughtlessness, and blushed
scarlet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; said she, and the words of the ballad rang in
her heart:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Prends tes amours en croupe,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">En avant!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; said he, laughing in his turn, &ldquo;you care
to take me <i>en croupe</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People would never stop talking about it all over
our Camargue,&rdquo; said she, with laughter in her voice. &ldquo;A
drover like you, the terror of riders, <i>en croupe</i> like a girl?
No, no; no false shame, that is my place. We will take
off my saddle, and you can bring it to me to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very luckily,&rdquo; said Renaud, &ldquo;Rampal didn&rsquo;t take
mine, which I never lend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Livette jumped down from her horse; and at the
breeze made by her skirt a cloud of great flies and
enormous mosquitoes rose and flew buzzing about her.
Blanchet&rsquo;s snow-white rump looked as if it were covered
with a net of purple silk, there was such a labyrinth of
little streams of blood crossing and recrossing one
another. Another instant, and gadflies and mosquitoes
settled down again upon the bleeding surface and dotted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
it with a myriad of black spots; but Blanchet, albeit
somewhat cross, was used to that annoyance.</p>

<p>Livette fastened him to one of the rings in the
wall, and sat down upon the stone bench, waiting until
Renaud had finished his <i>s&eacute;den</i>.</p>

<p>The wheel turned and turned, striking its dull blow
with perfect regularity at every turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a pretty song, Renaud,&rdquo; said Livette
suddenly, answering her thoughts without intention;
&ldquo;that was a pretty song you were singing just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I learned it,&rdquo; said Renaud, &ldquo;from a boatman, a
friend of my father, with whom I went up the Rh&ocirc;ne
as far as Lyon&mdash;and then came down again&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is all that country very beautiful up there?&rdquo;
said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;it is beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he said nothing more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look as if you meant what you say, Renaud.
Pray, didn&rsquo;t you like the city of Lyon we hear
so much about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a long silence, broken only by the monotonous
rhythm of the wheel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No sun!&rdquo; said Renaud abruptly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a city in
a cold cloud!&mdash;The Rh&ocirc;ne isn&rsquo;t fine till you come down
again,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>Livette looked at him, and her wide-open eyes seemed
to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
He answered her look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When one of us goes up yonder, young lady, you
understand, he leaves everything to go nowhere, and
when he gets there, all he asks is to start back again!&mdash;When
he comes from there here, on the contrary, he
leaves nothing at all, and knows that, at the end of the
journey, he will have arrived somewhere! You see,
young lady, the best horse must, of necessity, stop at
the sea&mdash;and that is the only place where I am willing
to consent to go no farther. Where the sea is not, you
have all the rest of the journey still to do.&mdash;Enough, my
boy!&rdquo; he added, raising his voice.</p>

<p>The wheel stopped. He examined the <i>s&eacute;den</i>. The
rope, of black and white strands in regular alternation,
was finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good piece of work,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;look,
young lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leaned over, almost against her, to look at a point
in the rope which seemed to him defective; he leaned
over, and a short black curl touched lightly the disordered,
almost invisible, locks that formed a sort of fleecy
golden cloud over Livette&rsquo;s forehead. And thereupon
it seemed to both of them&mdash;young as they were!&mdash;that
their hair blazed up and shrivelled softly, like the fine
grass that takes fire in summer, under the hot sun. Ah!
holy youth!</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, Renaud thought of the girl.
Hitherto he had seen in Livette only the &ldquo;young lady.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
They remained bending forward, she over the rope which
she seemed to be examining attentively, he over Livette&rsquo;s
hair. Livette wore her &ldquo;morning head-dress,&rdquo;
consisting of a little white handkerchief which covered
the <i>chignon</i>, and was tied in such fashion that the two
ends stood up like little hollow, pointed ears on top
of her head. When they are in full-dress, the women
of Camargue surround the high <i>chignon</i>, covered by a
fine white linen cap, with a broad velvet ribbon, almost
always black, whose long, unequal ends fall behind the
head, a little at one side.</p>

<p>Renaud, then, was looking at Livette&rsquo;s clear flaxen
hair,&mdash;in which there was, here and there, a lock of a
darker golden hue,&mdash;symmetrically massed on top of
her head, advancing in little waves toward her temples,
coquettishly arranged, but so short and fluffy that some
few locks escaped, here, there, and everywhere, enough
to form the faint golden mist above her head.</p>

<p>He looked at the pretty, round neck, whence the fair
hair seemed to spring, like a vigorous plant, so slender
and so fine! so long, and full of life! And the temptation
to press his lips upon it drew him on, as, after a
long day&rsquo;s journey among dry, stony hills, the sight
of the water draws on the horses of Camargue, accustomed
to moist pasturage.</p>

<p>She felt that she was being stared at too long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go!&rdquo; she said, suddenly. &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s
orders were that you should come as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
Renaud felt as if he were waking from a long sleep
and from a dream. He jumped to his feet. Without
a word, he went to Blanchet, took off the woman&rsquo;s saddle
and carried it into the house, placed his own upon
the beast, which the mosquitoes had at last made restive,
and leaped upon his back.</p>

<p>Livette, assisted by the drover&rsquo;s strong hand, leaped
to the croup behind him with one spring; highly amused
she was as she threw one arm around Renaud&rsquo;s waist.
It is the fashion among the Camarguese young women,
all of whom, on f&ecirc;te-days, ride to the plains of Meyran,
or to Saintes-Maries, &ldquo;fitted&rdquo; to the horses of their
promised husbands.</p>

<p>The drover started Blanchet off at a gallop, gave him
his head, and let him take his own course. Blanchet
left the travelled road, headed straight for the ch&acirc;teau
across the moor, through the sand thickly sown with
stiff, rounded clumps of saltwort at irregular intervals.
The good horse flew over these clumps, scarcely
touching the tops, landing always between them in
the damp sand, from which, however, by force of
long habit, he withdrew his feet without effort, calculating
in advance the distance between the obstacles,
galloping freely and evenly, changing feet as he chose,
making sport of his heavy burden, happy at being left
to himself.</p>

<p>And Livette must needs hold tight to the drover&rsquo;s
waist; he was a lithe, supple fellow, and swayed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
the horse. And the swift motion, the free air, youth
and love, all combined to intoxicate the two young
people; and without meaning it, without thinking of it,
the horseman repeated his song of a few moments before,
between his teeth, but loud enough to be overheard by
the girl:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Prends tes amours en croupe!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">En avant!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And it seemed to them as if the whole horizon were
theirs.</p>

<p>When they dismounted, in front of the farm-house of
the ch&acirc;teau, they had not spoken a word, but they had
exchanged in silence the subtlest and strongest part of
themselves.</p>

<p>From that day, Renaud, being sincerely in love, exerted
himself to please. He was careful about his dress,
paid more attention to the adjustment of his neckerchief,
shaved more closely, and had not a single
glance to spare for the other girls, even the prettiest of
them.</p>

<p>At last, he said to Livette one day:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father will never be willing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those were his first words of love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I am willing, my father will be. And when my
father is willing, grandmother always is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The good God grant it!&rdquo; replied Jacques.</p>

<p>And it had happened as she said. For almost five
months now they had been betrothed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
The fascinating thing about Livette was that she was
just the opposite of Renaud, so slender and delicate, so
fair and such a child,&mdash;and, furthermore, that she loved
him with all her might, the sweetheart,&mdash;there was no
mistake about that.</p>

<h2><a name="chap05" id="chap05"></a>V<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE LOVERS</span></h2>


<p>Livette was so fresh and sweet that people often repeated,
in speaking of her, the Proven&ccedil;al expression:
&ldquo;You could drink her in a glass of water!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In loving Livette, Renaud experienced the pleasant
feeling, so dear to the heart of strong men, of having
some one to protect, a little wife, who was no more than
a child. Because of Livette&rsquo;s fragility and slender
stature, the rough drover, made for violent passions,
the horseman of the Camargue desert, the hard-fisted
herdsman, the subduer of mares and bulls, felt the love
that is based upon sweet compassion, upon respect for
charming weakness; in a word, he learned the secret
of true tenderness which he could not have felt, perhaps,
for one of his own class.</p>

<p>It would never have occurred to him to tell her any
of the vulgar jests with a double meaning, with which
he regaled the more robust fair ones of his acquaintance
on branding-days or on race-days. To do that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
would have seemed to him to be a villainous misuse of
his power and his experience as a man. Still less did
Livette cause him to feel the fierce desire, well known
to him, which sometimes, with other girls, went to his
brain like a rush of blood,&mdash;the desire to touch with
his hands, to take in his arms, to throw down into
the ditch, laughing at the gentle resistance, at the consent
which repels a little, at the equal struggle between
the youth and the maiden, who have, in reality, a
tacit understanding to be robber and robbed. No: in
Livette&rsquo;s presence, Renaud felt that he was a new man.
There came to him, in regard to the little damsel
with the golden hair, a tranquillity of heart that surprised
him greatly. Love has a thousand forms. That
which Renaud felt for Livette was a soothing emotion.
He &ldquo;wished her well.&rdquo; That was what he kept
repeating to himself as he thought of her. And, as he
desired all the others something after the fashion of the
bulls of his <i>manade</i>, in the season when the germs are
at work, it so happened that he seemed not to desire the
only woman he really loved.</p>

<p>There was a sweet fascination in the thought, which
he relished like a draught of pure water after a long
day&rsquo;s walk through the dust in the hot sun. He rejoiced
inwardly in his love as in a halt for rest in the
shade of a great tree, beside a clear, cool spring, while
the birds sang their greeting to the morning. Sometimes,
in the blazing heat of midday, when he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
riding across the mirror-like waste of sand and salt and
water, his horse plodding wearily along with hanging
head, the thought of Livette would steal softly into his
mind, and it would seem as if a cool breeze were blowing
on his forehead, washing away, in a sense, the dust
and fatigue, like a bath. He would feel refreshed, and
a smile would come unbidden to his lips. His whole
being would thrill with pleasure, and, with renewed
life, he would imperceptibly, with hand and knee alike,
order his horse to raise his head. And the lover&rsquo;s steed
would raise his head without further bidding, and snort
and toss his mane, scatter, with a sudden lash of his
tail, the gadflies that were streaking his sides with blood,
and, with quickened step, reach the shelter of the hawthorns
and the poplars on the Rh&ocirc;ne bank&mdash;whose
leaves forever quiver and rustle like the water, like the
heart of man, like everything that lives and hopes and
suffers and then dies!</p>

<p>Not only by her grace and weakness did she win his
heart, strong and rough as he was; but also by the care
expended on her dress, by the splendor of her surroundings,
she, the wealthy farmer&rsquo;s daughter, enchanted
him, the poor drover; and she seemed to him a strange,
unfamiliar creature from another world. And so she
was in fact. Of a different quality, he said to himself:
a being outside his sphere, far, far above it.</p>

<p>That he might one day unloose the latchets of her
little shoes had not occurred to him, and, lo! she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
his! Livette, the daughter of the intendant of the
Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon! she was his fianc&eacute;e, his betrothed,
his future wife!</p>

<p>He seemed to himself the heir to a throne. In face
of the mere thought of his future, he felt something
like the embarrassment a beggar feels on the threshold
of a palace, before the carpets over which he must pass
to enter, with shoes heavy with mud.</p>

<p>She had in his eyes something of the sanctity of the
blessed Madonna, carved from wood, painted blue and
gold, and overladen with pearls and flowers, that he used
to see when a child in the church of Saint-Trophime at
Arles.</p>

<p>So it was that he felt a secret amazement at finding
himself beloved.</p>

<p>It did not seem to him that it could really be true;
and as he must needs be convinced of the fact every
time he spoke to her, his love constantly appealed to
him with all the force of novelty.</p>

<p>He was a little embarrassed, too, in her presence, could
not find his words, contented himself with smiling at
her, with yielding submission to her like a child, with
running to fetch this or that for her, divining her desires
from her glance; mistaking now and then, but rarely;
feeling the same pleasure in being the maiden&rsquo;s footman
that is felt by the misshapen court dwarf in love with
the king&rsquo;s fair daughter.</p>

<p>His sobriquet of <em>The King</em> seemed to him a mockery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
beside her. She embarrassed him; in her presence he
was meek and lowly.</p>

<p>He was surprised, indignant even, in his heart, at the
familiar tone assumed by others with Livette. It seemed
strange to him that her companions should treat her as
an equal; that her father and her grandmother should
not have the same respect and consideration for his
fianc&eacute;e that he himself had.</p>

<p>Frequently, when the grandmother cried to Livette:
&ldquo;Do this or that; run! be quick!&rdquo; he would be angry,
and would long to say to her: &ldquo;Why do you order her
about? She was not made to obey! You&rsquo;re a bad
grandmother! Don&rsquo;t you see that she is too delicate
and pretty for such tasks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this was a feeling kept hidden in his heart; he
would not have dared to avow it, for women are made,
according to our ancestors, to be the slaves of man. So
he said no word of what he felt. He even deemed himself
a little ridiculous to feel it. He contented himself
by doing in a twinkling, in Livette&rsquo;s stead, the thing
she was bidden to do, if it was something within his
power.</p>

<p>Ah! but if any man had ventured to indulge in any
ill-sounding pleasantry with Livette, to take any liberty
with her&mdash;oh! then, be sure that he would without reflection
have felled him on the spot with his stout fist!</p>

<p>Why, if any one, man or woman, in the crowd on
a f&ecirc;te-day, happened to make a coarse remark in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
hearing,&mdash;one of the sort that he himself knew how to
make with great effect upon occasion,&mdash;he would be
overcome with rage against that person; it seemed to
him that every one should take notice of Livette&rsquo;s presence,
should feel that she was near, and understand
that, before her, they should show some self-respect.</p>

<p>All this he would have been incapable of explaining,
but he felt it all, confusedly and vaguely, in his heart.</p>

<p>Livette, for her part, was keenly conscious of the
drover&rsquo;s adoration. She revelled in it, without unduly
seeming to do so. She saw very plainly that she had,
without effort, tamed a wild beast. She laughed sometimes,
as she looked at him&mdash;a frank, ringing laugh, in
which there was, however, a touch of the triumph of
the mysterious feminine witchery, the marvellous invention
of nature, which decrees that the strong man shall
be vanquished, rolled in the dust, at the pleasure of
fascinating weakness. This miracle, performed by life,
by nature, by love, she believed to be her own work,&mdash;hers,
Livette&rsquo;s,&mdash;and the little woman was a bit swollen
with pride! More than frequently she would say to herself:
&ldquo;What have I done? I don&rsquo;t deserve this good
fortune; no, indeed, I don&rsquo;t deserve it!&rdquo; She saw very
clearly that, in his eyes, she was a being apart: that he
did not treat her by any means as everybody else did:
and, greatly astonished as she was, she was proud of it.</p>

<p>Thereupon, wondering in her sincere heart what she
had &ldquo;more&rdquo; or better than another, and finding no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
answer to the question, it came about that she deemed
her lover a little, just a very little, stupid to be so dominated
by her, and he so strong! And then she would
prettily make fun of him and laugh aloud at him, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! great booby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it was that the whole essence of Woman, profound,
seductive, existed in this simple, obscure peasant-girl,
who could have told nothing as to her own character.</p>

<p>In time, too, she came to look upon herself as pretty,
beautiful, the prettiest, the loveliest of all, and to admire
her own charms. When such thoughts came to her, and
if the truth must be known, none were more frequent,&mdash;ah!
then she felt her pride! And she no longer deemed
her lover stupid in the least degree; on the contrary,
he seemed to her very fortunate, too fortunate! and
then it was he who hardly deserved her! At such times,
she received his attentions, his humility, with the air of
a princess accustomed to homage.</p>

<p>Then, too, she would wonder why all the others did
not do for her what he did? And, thereupon, she would
conceive a sort of gratitude for him. Such a constant
revolution in our hearts of impressions, often irreconcilable
and ever changing, around a fixed idea, is love.&mdash;Yes,
in very truth he deserved to be loved simply because
he had known enough to appreciate her! to choose her!
The other young men were the fools, one and all!</p>

<p>Warm was his welcome if he arrived at the farm
when that thought was in her mind. She would give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
the little cry of a happy bird, and run to meet her
lover.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Monsieur Jacques!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Demoiselle Livette!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They would shake hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you come to the Rh&ocirc;ne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With all my heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And often they would go and sit together beside the
Rh&ocirc;ne, beneath the great hawthorn&mdash;a tree more than
a hundred years old and known to everybody. The
hawthorn, like the aspen and the birch, is a familiar
Camarguese tree.</p>

<p>Sometimes, on the way, she would hold out to him
a flexible green twig, broken from a poplar by the roadside,
and they would walk along, united and kept apart
at the same time by the short branch, followed by a
swarm of gnats with their tiny iris-hued wings.</p>

<p>She was very fond of this sport of making him walk
thus, not too near, not too far away, holding him without
touching him, drawing him nearer or keeping him
at a distance, as her fancy dictated, making of the leafy
wand a whip if he showed signs of rebellion.</p>

<p>She had the feeling that thus she was indeed his mistress,
remembering how she used sometimes to make her
horse Blanchet follow her docilely in the same way by
holding out to him a small wisp of flowering oats;&mdash;how
she had sometimes, by the same means, led back
behind her, quiet as an ox, a vicious bull that had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
escaped, wounded, from the arena, and that she had
encountered by the roadside, in a thicket of thorn-broom,
bathing his foaming tongue in the streams of
blood that were flowing from his nostrils.</p>

<p>Arrived at the bank of the Rh&ocirc;ne, beneath the great
hawthorn with the gnarled black trunk and smooth white
branches, that stretches its abundant rustling foliage well
out over the stream, the lovers would sit down, side by
side, upon the roots protruding from the ground or upon
a bundle of cut reeds.</p>

<p>And they would watch the water flow. The earthy,
yellowish water, with its whirling masses of foam, rushing
toward the sea.</p>

<p>They would sit and gaze.</p>

<p>They would not speak. They would live on in silence,
listening to the plashing of the Rh&ocirc;ne, the tiny wavelets
that came rippling in obliquely to the bank, to loiter
there among the feet of countless reeds and poplars,
while the main current in the centre of the stream flowed
swiftly, hurriedly along, as if in haste to reach the sea,
and there be swallowed up.&mdash;There they would sit and
dream, not speaking.</p>

<p>They felt that they were living the same life as everything
about them. From time to time, a kingfisher,
sky-blue and reddish-brown, would pass before them,
light on a low branch, gazing sidewise at the water with
his beak ready to strike, then, suddenly, fly off across
the Rh&ocirc;ne. And, with the sky-blue bird, their thoughts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
would cross the river, there to light again upon a
branch, bent like a bow, whose slender point trailed in
the water, vibrating in the current, and surrounded with
a mass of foam, dead leaves, and twigs. And suddenly
the bird, like a sorcerer, had disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How pretty!&rdquo; Livette would sometimes say.</p>

<p>And that was all.</p>

<p>He would make no reply. He knew not what to say
to her. He was too happy. He would not call the
king his cousin!</p>

<p>In the evening twilight, many little rabbits, young
in that month of May, would run out from the park,
through the wild hedges, almost invisible in their gray
coats, and play in the shadow at the foot of the bushes,
their presence betrayed by the rustling of a tuft of
grass or a low-hanging, horizontal branch that barred
their path.</p>

<p>To heighten the enjoyment of the lovers, there was the
nightingale&rsquo;s song, at the rising of the moon. Listen
to it: &rsquo;tis always lovely in the darkness, is the nightingale&rsquo;s
song. It begins with three distinct, long-drawn-out
cries; you would say it was a signal, a preconcerted
call; it enjoins attention. Then the modulations hesitatingly
arise. You would say that it is timid, that it
fears its prayer will not be granted. But soon it takes
courage, self-assurance comes, and the song bursts forth
and soars and fills the air with its melodious uproar.
&rsquo;Tis love, &rsquo;tis youth and love that can no longer be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
restrained, that nothing stays, that claim their rights in
life.&mdash;His song is done.</p>

<p>His song is done, but still the lovers listen on and on
to the bird&rsquo;s song, echoed in the dark recesses of their
own hearts.</p>

<p>At last, it would be time to return. They would rise
and walk back toward the farm, not far away.</p>

<p>The grandmother would be calling from the doorway:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Livette! Livette!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice would reach their ears, with a plaintive,
caressing accent, tinged with sadness, from the edge of
the vast expanse that rose in the darkness toward the
stars, toward life and love,&mdash;a long, melancholy call.
The voice at night upon the moor fills the air and rises
tranquilly, disturbed by no echo, sad to be alone in a
too great solitude.</p>

<p>Around the lovers as they returned to the farm, in
the orchards, in the park, as the darkness increased, the
deafening clamor of the frogs would soon be heard, a
mighty noise, the sum total of a multitude of feeble
sounds, a frightful din, composed of many minor croakings
of unequal strength, which, massed together,
drowning one another, mount at last into a rhythmic
tumult like the ceaseless roaring of a cataract.</p>

<p>And amid this formidable everlasting clamor, made
by the voices of myriads of amorous little frogs, accentuated
by the cry of a curlew, or a heron on the watch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
and accompanied by the humming of the two Rh&ocirc;nes and
the plashing of the sea&mdash;the lovers, both deeply moved,
heard nothing save the calm beating of their hearts.</p>

<p>As time went on, their love waxed greater, increased
by the memory of all these hours lived together.</p>

<p>Renaud was no longer simple Renaud in Livette&rsquo;s
eyes, but the being by whom she knew what life was,
through whom came to her that overwhelming consciousness
of everything, of the horizons of land and
sea, that sentiment of <em>being</em>, that longing for the future,
for growth, that inflow of vague hopes that comes of
love and gives a zest to life.</p>

<p>And now, if any one had sought to wrest Jacques
from Livette, she would have died of it, and he who
should try to wrest Livette from Jacques would have
died of it&mdash;he would, my friends, even more certainly.</p>

<p>It is a good and excellent thing that love should be
always busied in making the world younger&mdash;and the
nightingale, like the frogs, is never weary of repeating
it.</p>

<h2><a name="chap06" id="chap06"></a>VI<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">RAMPAL</span></h2>


<p>Rampal, who had borrowed Jacques Renaud&rsquo;s horse,
had not returned.</p>

<p>Renaud now rode no other horse than Blanchet.</p>

<p>Rampal was a low rascal, gambler, hanger-on of wine-shops,
well-known at Arles in all the vile haunts scattered
along the Rh&ocirc;ne.</p>

<p>Dismissed by several masters, a drover without a
drove, he passed his life in these days, riding from town
to town, from Aigues-Mortes to N&icirc;mes, from N&icirc;mes to
Arles, from Arles to Martigues, and in each of these
towns plied some doubtful trade, cheated a little at cards,
winning the means of living a week without doing anything,
and returning, for that week, to the Camargue he
loved, where there were, in two or three farm-houses,
women who smiled upon his mysterious, piratical existence.</p>

<p>For that existence, a horse was essential. Rampal,
serving as a drover on foot, had, in the first place, stolen
a horse from a <i>manade</i>, but he broke his tether the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
second night, left his master, swam the Rh&ocirc;ne, and rejoined
his fellows. Then it was that the rascal, having,
in truth, important business on hand, had said to
Renaud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to go to Saintes, I&rsquo;ll take your horse,
Cabri.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take my horse,&rdquo; Renaud replied.</p>

<p>It did not occur to him that Rampal would not return.
Jacques relied so surely upon his own reputation
for strength and courage that he did not think that any
one would venture to arouse his wrath.</p>

<p>And then he had a sort of pity for Rampal, mingled
with a little admiration. He was a bold horseman, was
Rampal, and, except for women and cards, he would
have been, with Renaud, or just after him, a king of the
drovers! So that, if Rampal aroused Renaud&rsquo;s compassion,
Renaud aroused Rampal&rsquo;s envy.</p>

<p>However, the vagaries of this <i>marrias</i>, this good-for-nothing
knave, were the pranks of a free man. Neither
married nor betrothed, fatherless and motherless, with
no one to support or assist, no one whom he must please,
he had a perfect right to live as he pleased! At least,
that is what most people thought.</p>

<p>Moreover, Renaud, although an honest man, had the
tastes of a vagabond. Before his heart was filled with
his strange affection for Livette, by which he felt as if
he were bound hand and foot, he had, in truth, borne
a part with Rampal in many curious adventures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
More than once they had galloped along side by side
toward the open moor, each having <i>en croupe</i> a laughing
damsel, who, after the close of a bull-fight at Aigues-Mortes
or Arles, had consented to accompany them for
a night.</p>

<p>But on such occasions Renaud had always dealt frankly,
never promising marriage nor any other thing, but simply
giving the fair one a present, a souvenir, a brass ring, or
a silk handkerchief&mdash;a <i>fichu</i> to pleat after the Arlesian
fashion, or a broad velvet ribbon for a head-dress; while
Rampal was treacherous, promised much and did nothing,&mdash;in
short, was nothing but <i>f&eacute;na</i>, a good-for-nothing.</p>

<p>So Rampal had borrowed Renaud&rsquo;s horse with the
intention of bringing him back the same evening; but
that evening he had heard of a f&ecirc;te at Martigues and
had ridden away thither without worrying about Renaud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll take a horse out of his <i>manade</i>,&rdquo; he said to
himself.</p>

<p>Now, Audiffret, Livette&rsquo;s father, had insisted that
Renaud should take Blanchet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take Blanchet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to have
our girl ride him. He&rsquo;s a fine horse, but bad-tempered
at times. Finish breaking him for us. I want him to
run in the races at B&eacute;ziers this year. Take him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Happy to have Blanchet in the hands of &ldquo;her dear,&rdquo;
for so she already called Renaud in her heart, Livette,
who was fond of Blanchet, simply said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take good care of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
That was more than six months before.</p>

<p>Rampal, who had caused considerable gossip meanwhile,
and of whom Renaud had heard more than once,
had not brought back the horse.</p>

<p>Renaud did not lose his patience. Several times,
being informed that Rampal was in this or that place,
he had tried to find him, but had not succeeded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall catch him some day!&rdquo; said Renaud. &ldquo;He
loses nothing by waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hoped that the f&ecirc;te at Saintes-Maries would bring
the rascal back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will come back with the thieving gipsies!&rdquo; he
said; and he was not mistaken.</p>

<p>Not for an empire would Rampal have missed making
the pilgrimage to Saintes-Maries. The rascal would have
thought himself everlastingly damned. It had been his
habit from childhood to come and ask forgiveness of his
sins from the two Marys and Sara the bondwoman, at
whom he did nothing but laugh in a boastful way, unable
to satisfy himself whether he believed in them or not.</p>

<p>This year, being affiliated with the gipsies in matters
of horse-trading (every one knows that the gipsies, men
and women,&mdash;<i>roms</i> and <i>juwas</i>, as they say,&mdash;have a
profound acquaintance with everything connected with
the horse), Rampal had been a fruitful source of information
to them.</p>

<p>By divers methods they had led him to talk about this
and that, about every one and everything. He had no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
idea himself that he had told so many things. They
had questioned him, sometimes directly, taking him unawares;
sometimes in a slow, roundabout way; when he
was drunk, and when he was asleep. And his replies
had been pitilessly registered in the gipsies&rsquo; unfailing
memory&mdash;the wherewithal to astonish all Camargue.</p>

<p>Rampal had not even been questioned by the gipsy
queen, who did not trust his discretion; she learned the
secrets of the province at second-hand.</p>

<p>Once only had he spoken to her. It was one evening
when the beggar queen began to dance for her own
amusement on the high-road, to the music of her tambourine,
which she hardly ever laid aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are beautiful!&rdquo; he said to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are ugly!&rdquo; she replied, quickly, in a contemptuous
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me the ring on your finger,&rdquo; said Rampal,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll give you another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She glanced with a gleaming eye at her fantastic ring
of hammered silver, then at the insolent Christian, and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sound cudgelling about your loins is what I will
give you, dog, if you don&rsquo;t leave me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she spat fiercely at him as if in disgust.</p>

<p>Rampal, somewhat abashed, abandoned the game.</p>

<p>This woman had a way of looking at people that
disconcerted them. You would say that a sharp, threatening
flame shot from her eyes. It penetrated your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
being, searched your heart, and you were powerless
against it. She fathomed your glance, but you could
not fathom hers&mdash;which, on the contrary, repelled you,
turned you back like a solid wall. And, at such moments,
she would stand proudly erect, her head thrown
slightly back, her whole body poised, at once so sinuous
and so rigid, that she might have been compared to a
horned viper standing on his tail, fascinating his prey
and preparing to spring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain, Jacques, how that woman frightened
me,&rdquo; said Livette to Renaud. &ldquo;My blood is still
running cold!&mdash;She threatened me! And when that
crown of thorns fell at my feet&mdash;Holy Mother!&mdash;I
thought I was going to faint!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I meet her,&rdquo; Renaud replied, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll find she
has some one to settle with!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the heathen alone, Jacques! It isn&rsquo;t well to
have aught to do with the devil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the drover loved a fight, and he longed for nothing
so much as to fall in with Rampal and Zinzara, the
gambler and the queen of the cards; &ldquo;a pair of gipsies,
a pair of thieves,&rdquo; thought Renaud.</p>

<h2><a name="chap07" id="chap07"></a>VII<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE MEETING</span></h2>


<p>The gipsy queen was the first of the two he met.</p>

<p>Renaud, mounted on Blanchet, was riding along the
beach toward Saintes-Maries.</p>

<p>The sea was at his right; at his left, the desert. He
was riding through the sand, and from time to time the
waves rolled up under his horse&rsquo;s feet, surrounding with
sportive foam the rosy hoofs rapidly rising and falling.</p>

<p>Renaud was thinking of Livette.</p>

<p>He looked ahead and saw the tall, straight, battlemented
walls of Saintes-Maries, and wondered whether
he would lead his little queen, dressed in white, and
crowned with flowers, to the altar there, or at Saint-Trophime
in Arles.</p>

<p>He looked at the sea and wondered if nothing would
come to him from that source; if his uncle, captain of
a merchantman, who sailed on his last voyage so many
years ago, would not come into port some day with a
cargo of vague, marvellous things, a million in priceless
stuffs and precious stones? In the poor, ignorant fellow&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
imagination, the thought of a fortune was a vision of
legendary treasures, like those discovered in caverns in
the Arabian tales.</p>

<p>For an instant, he seemed to see it with his eyes, to
see his vision realized in the dazzling splendor of the
boundless sea, that lay glistening in the sunlight, with
sharp, fitful flashes, like a mirror broken into narrow,
moving fragments of irregular shape. It was an undulating
sheet of diamonds and sapphires. The sun&rsquo;s rays,
as he sank lower and lower toward the horizon, assumed
a ruddier hue as they fell obliquely upon the fast-subsiding
waves, and soon the water was like a sheet of old burnished
gold, moving slowly up and down; one would
have said it was a vast melted treasure beneath a polished
vitreous surface! At long intervals, a solitary
wave greater than its fellows fell with a dull roar upon
the beach, and ever and anon a cloud passed overhead;
and in the mist flying from the gold-tipped wave, in the
slow-moving shadow of the cloud, the water seemed a
deep, dark blue. The sun sank lower, and broad bright
red bands began to overshadow the bands of ochre,
amethyst, light green, pale blue, that rose one above
another on the horizon line. The changing sea was
now like a cloak of royal purple, with fringe of azure,
gold, and silver.</p>

<p>On the desert side, the marshes likewise were changed
to vast floors carpeted with gorgeous drapery and rich
embroidery. Everything was ablaze with sparkles&mdash;sea,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
sand, and salt. At intervals, a red flamingo rose from
among the reeds, flew heavily along, seeming to carry
on his side a little of the ruddy hue of sky and sea,&mdash;then
lighted on the brink of the gleaming water.</p>

<p>The gulls were like white dream-birds in this enchanted
country. They sat in lines, like brooding
doves, on the crests of the waves in the offing, or on
the hot sands, or on the surface of the ponds.</p>

<p>And, down in the northwest, Renaud was looking for
the high, square terrace of the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon, for
Livette sometimes went up there to see if she could
not spy Blanchet and her dear Renaud&rsquo;s straight spear
somewhere in the plain.</p>

<p>Suddenly Renaud checked his horse and gazed fixedly
at a black object moving on the surface of the water,
rising and falling with the motion of the waves, some
two hundred feet from shore.</p>

<p>He thought he could descry a woman&rsquo;s head; a head
covered with dripping black hair and surrounded by a
copper circlet, from which depended glistening Oriental
medallions.</p>

<p>The gipsy was swimming, disporting herself in the
waves, which, coming from the deep sea, rose and
fell slowly and at long intervals. She glided through
them like a conger-eel, happy in the sensation caused by
the gentle lapping of the salt water caressing her flesh.
Her movements were undulating, like those of the waves
themselves; she writhed and twisted like seaweed tossed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
about by the surf. Now and then a heavier, higher wave
would come upon her. She would turn and face it, put
her hands together in a point above her lowered head,
as divers do, plunge into the broad wave horizontally,
and cleave it through from front to rear.</p>

<p>From his horse, Renaud watched the dark head emerge
on the other side of the swelling wave, which, as it
approached the shore, curled over with whitening crest,
broke upon the beach in snowy foam and spread out
over the sand, beneath and all about him, in shallow,
transparent, overlapping streams, all studded with sparks.
He could not see the swimmer&rsquo;s body distinctly. Its
fleeting outlines could scarcely be made out beneath the
clear, transparent water, ere they were blotted out again
by the undulations and reflections.</p>

<p>Suddenly the swimmer turned toward the shore, apparently
gained a footing, and, raising one arm out of
the water, motioned to Renaud to be gone, shouting:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go your way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he, who had thus far watched her with curiosity
and with no feeling of anger, was irritated by those
words. Certainly he had forgotten none of Livette&rsquo;s
grievances against the gipsy. Not a week had passed
since her threatening visit to the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon.
But, in that beautiful evening light, Renaud&rsquo;s heart felt
at peace, and he had recognized the gipsy queen without
emotion. It may be that curiosity was dominant in
his heart, and urged him toward this mysterious being,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
surprised in her bath, in the utter solitude of the desert at
evening; the curiosity of a traveller to examine a strange
animal, of a Christian to investigate a heathen woman.
&ldquo;Go your way!&rdquo; This command, hurled at him from
afar by a woman&rsquo;s voice, wounded him in that part of
his heart where the memory of the gipsy&rsquo;s threat against
Livette was stored away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you, who go about and
stand in doorways to frighten young girls when they
happen to be left alone! who tell lies and play monkey-tricks
to make them give you what they refuse to give!
Don&rsquo;t let it happen again, thief! or you&rsquo;ll find out how
the pitchfork and the goad feel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The insulted queen was absolutely convulsed with furious
rage. If she had been near the drover, she would
have jumped straight at his throat, as the serpent straightens
itself out like an arrow and darts at its prey. She
felt that she grew pale, a shiver ran through her whole
body, and swaying a little, like the adder about to
spring, with her head thrown slightly back, she walked
toward the horseman&mdash;but how far away he was!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you are coming near to hear
better! Come on, you heathen, come! I will explain
it all to you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he remembered how the woman had threatened
Livette, his wrath rose within him. They were not
Christians, these Bohemian creatures, but thieves, bandits,
one and all. Why, it was said that they ate human
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
flesh, child&rsquo;s flesh, when they could find nothing better.
If that were not true, how would they have whole quarters
of bleeding flesh in their kettles so often? Ah! a
race of wolves, of accursed foxes!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he cried again.</p>

<p>She came on, but not without difficulty, having to
force her way step by step through the resisting waves.
Her shoulders were not yet visible, and she was accelerating
her speed by using her arms under the water.
She could have made the same distance more quickly
by swimming, but she did not even think of that. She
was thinking of something very different!</p>

<p>Renaud mechanically cast his eye along the shore,
behind him, and saw, a few steps away, the gipsy&rsquo;s
clothes lying in a heap out of reach of the waves,&mdash;and
her tambourine on top of them; then he looked around
once more at the woman coming toward him. The
water was now up to her armpits, and not until then
did he see that she was entirely naked.</p>

<p>Her bust slowly emerged from the water. At a hundred
paces from the shore, the water reached only to her
knees. She was beautiful. Her slender, well-knit body
was very youthful. She stood very erect, and seemed as
if she were going into battle without any thought of
shame. She had been assailed: she was rushing at her
assailant, that was the whole of it. Her fists were
clenched, her arms slightly bent, her head still thrown
back a little. Her whole attitude was threatening.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
The water was rolling down in glistening pearls from
her neck to her feet, over every part of her swarthy,
bronzed body. Her swelling chest seemed to be put
forward, as if it were ready, like a magic buckler, to
receive the blows that would be powerless to injure it.</p>

<p>The drover sat still in speechless amazement. He gazed
at the approaching woman, who, as he saw her, springing
from the water, surrounded by white foam, with her unusual
coloring, appeared to him like a supernatural being.</p>

<p>What was she there for? She came forward, boldly
aggressive; and her witch&rsquo;s mind was revolving many
evil schemes, no doubt.</p>

<p>Did she not bend over a moment, as if to pick up
pebbles from beneath the water, with which to stone her
enemy? Was she not holding them now in her clenched
fists. No: the sands of Camargue stretch very far beneath
the water, sloping very gradually, and not the tiniest
pebble meets the swimmer&rsquo;s bare foot.</p>

<p>What was she doing then?</p>

<p>And now she was close beside the horseman, whose
curiosity constantly increased. But he had ceased questioning
himself. He simply stared at her, stupefied and
enchanted.</p>

<p>He followed her with his eyes, fascinated, forgetting
his spear resting upon his stirrup, forgetting his horse,
forgetting everything.</p>

<p>And now she was within three paces of him, standing
perfectly straight, insolent in her whole bearing, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
every undulation of her figure, looking him in the
face, with eyes from which a steely flame shot forth,
and which no other eye could penetrate. And as she
presented her profile to him for a second, he had a
swift, hardly conscious thought that the lower part of
the face&mdash;from below the nostrils to the base of the
chin&mdash;resembled the head of the lizard of the sand,
and the turtles and snakes of the swamp. There was
the same vertical line, broken by thin, slightly-receding
lips, whence he expected to see a forked, vibrating
tongue come forth, as in a dream of the devil.</p>

<p>But this impression was but momentary, and he saw
naught but the woman, young, fair, unclothed, seemingly
offering herself voluntarily to his savage lust, in
the security of that deserted shore, amid the plashing
of the waves, in the fresh breeze blowing from the
sea, and the evening sunlight, which, with the salt
water, coursed in streams over the whole lovely body.</p>

<p>Dazzled, blinded, drunken with the waves of blood,
which from his heart, whither it had rushed at first,
suffocating him and making him waver in his saddle,&mdash;now
poured back to his brain, suffusing his face and
bull-like neck with red,&mdash;he was about to leap down
from his horse, or perhaps to stoop over only, snatch
up the creature&mdash;a mere feather in his hands&mdash;by
strength of wrist, and centaur-like carry her away <i>en
croupe</i>,&mdash;when she, more prompt to act, darted forward,
stretching out her arms, and with her left hand seized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
and pulled back with all her strength the double rein
of Renaud&rsquo;s horse, making him rear and fall back.
And with her right hand she struck the creature&rsquo;s face!</p>

<p class="caption">He saw naught but the woman, young, fair, unclothed,
seemingly offering herself voluntarily to his savage
lust, *** when she, more prompt to act, darted
forward, stretching out her arms, and with her left hand
seized and pulled back with all her strength the double
rein of Renaud&rsquo;s horse, making him rear and fall back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go, dog! go and tell your people that a woman has
revenged herself upon you and has struck the horseman
on his horse&rsquo;s face! Coward! Vile neat-herd! Go
and tell it to your sweetheart! Go, tell her that when
I struck you, you knew not what to do or say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no wrath left in Renaud; he had no feeling
but fear mingled with amazement. The woman&rsquo;s
performance seemed to him in very truth surprising,
diabolical. In coloring, bearing, expression, and audacity,
she was the sorceress to the life. A strange terror
took possession of him. Perhaps he would have gone
astray gaily, without remorse, with any other than this
ill-omened gipsy, who terrified him. He was especially
alarmed for Livette. He felt that she, and he himself
with her, were threatened by some mysterious, obscure
disaster; and the thought of being unfaithful to her
filled him with dismay, as the beginning of the end.
He was afraid of himself; afraid, for Livette, of this
unforeseen, inexplicable creature, who rose up before
him, challenging him to contend with her, for what?&mdash;Thus,
malignity and hatred brought the woman to him
as love would not have done!&mdash;He was bewildered.
He simply waited till his rein should be let go, ready to
start off at a gallop, feeling no longer in his heart the
wrath a man must feel in order to ride down any woman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
though she were a witch, and trample her beneath his
horse&rsquo;s feet, at the risk of killing her.</p>

<p>But why was he no longer angry? Because his eyes,
against his will, followed every movement of that body
with its weird beauty,&mdash;the body of an enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would like to fly like a coward, would you?&rdquo;
she suddenly cried. &ldquo;You shall not go until I choose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Profiting by the horseman&rsquo;s open-mouthed stupor, she
had seized with her teeth a hanging end of the lasso that
was coiled about the horse&rsquo;s neck, and with the assistance
of one hand&mdash;the other still holding the rein&mdash;had
swiftly passed it about the nostrils and tied it in
a cruel knot. With a fierce pull upon this instrument
of torture, she held the beast fast just where she wished
him to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must wait until your comrades pass!&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;They must see a bull-tamer tamed by a woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; thought Renaud, &ldquo;that would be,
as she says, a very absurd thing!&rdquo; And he drew his
horse back a little, thinking he might release him, but
the horse stretched out his head and neck, balked,
dropped his tail, and stiffened his four legs, as if he
were tied to a wall. The gipsy did not stir. She
laughed, showing an unbroken set of small, white,
pretty, formidable teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; said Renaud at last, &ldquo;I am going to
ride my horse upon you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I defy you to do it!&rdquo; she replied tranquilly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
She saw with her unerring glance signs of confusion
in the drover&rsquo;s eyes: the charm was working! Through
a mist he now gazed upon this woman, whose captive he
was, by virtue of a burning curiosity already closely akin
to love. She smiled.</p>

<p>This lasted some time. At last, Renaud felt that his
wits were leaving him. To remain faithful to Livette,
whom he could not betray with the very woman upon
whom he had promised to avenge her, he must not dismount
from his horse, for as soon as he put his foot
to the ground he would have become the stronger of
the two! To remain faithful he must have courage to
remain vanquished in this struggle of beauty against
strength. And he waited.</p>

<p>She surprised the drover glancing for an instant
toward the moor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha! you are afraid some one will see you, coward!
but never fear! Every one shall know what has happened
to you, all the same. I will take care of that!
Some day you shall come and tell me what your pale-faced,
white-blooded blonde had to say to it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Humiliated at being forced thus to obey a woman, but
rendered wavering and weak by the physical delight she
caused him to feel, he remained where he was! His
horse, as he irritated without maddening him, tried
several times to free himself, but without success. Renaud
looked on. Slight, supple as a tiger&rsquo;s whelp,
active and strong, and accustomed to contend with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
horses, the gipsy, still holding the cruel cord in her left
hand, had seized the long mane and wound it about her
right hand, and when the horse reared, she being thus
made fast to him, allowed herself to be raised from the
ground, standing erect upon the tips of her rigid toes&mdash;or
else she would twine her feet about the rider&rsquo;s leg,
clinging to him as the polypus clings, with its tendons to
the rock, and laughing always, with a wicked, obstinate,
triumphant air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall never be rid of me again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last, becoming more and more alarmed, he came
to have a horror of her, as of a poisonous insect, seen
in a dream, a spider or a dragon-fly, that follows you
obstinately, or of an adder that conceives a strange,
almost human hatred for you, persists in following your
footsteps, with unwearying patience, and becomes an
object of terror, despite his puny size, because of his
supernatural tenacity.</p>

<p>And in very truth the fierce resolution, the malevolent
perseverance, the demoniacal obstinacy of the woman,
protected as she was by her beauty and her weakness,
were terrifying.</p>

<p>But the play of the muscles, causing that gleaming
flesh, now moist with perspiration, to throb and undulate,
aroused the man&rsquo;s interest, in spite of everything,
and pleased him more and more. Desire awoke
in him. And instantly he refused to accept his defeat,
and rebelled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; he cried, and he urged his horse forward,
driving his spurs into his sides; but the beast,
held fast by the nostrils, gave but three leaps and then
stopped short, breathing fire. Poor Blanchet, who was
used to his young mistress&rsquo;s caresses and sweetmeats! he
was learning now to know woman&rsquo;s true nature.</p>

<p>At last, the gipsy released her double prey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go! you have looked at me enough!&rdquo; she suddenly
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Renaud gazed at her an instant longer, without speaking
or moving. The strength and chaotic character of
his temptations held him fast there for another moment.
So this extraordinary experience (which would never be
repeated!) was ended at last!&mdash;Mad thoughts, each clear
enough in itself, but confused by their great number,
jostled one another in his brain. Why had he not
sooner put an end to this conflict? What would people
say of him when it was known? How could it be that
he, the king of the moor, had not stooped to pick up
this joy?&mdash;But Livette?&mdash;ah, yes! Livette!</p>

<p>He buried his spurs in Blanchet&rsquo;s flanks, and the beast
flew away toward Saintes-Maries.</p>

<p>The gipsy stood on the shore a long while, looking
after the fugitive. She smiled. She reviewed in her
mind the varying fortunes of the battle, and gauged the
extent of her victory. She recalled, one by one, to enjoy
them to the full, the thoughts that had passed through
her mind when she was wading toward the shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
She had not premeditated her assault, as she made
it&mdash;her first idea had been to pick up some stones and
throw them at Renaud&rsquo;s head, being an adept in the
art. But she could find none. So she had continued
her forward movement, not knowing what she would
do, but certain that she must do something to punish
the insolent Christian.</p>

<p>But when she felt the cool air blowing upon her bare
breast, she had said to herself in her mysterious language,
full of cabalistic words and images, that if a saint
had been able to recompense a boatman&mdash;her good
friend&mdash;simply by revealing to him her beauty all unclothed,
a heathen might, by similar means, chastise a
brutal drover; for love is the magician&rsquo;s herb, the bitter-sweet,
the plant with two savors, balm and poison at
once; and woman is bitter as the salt sea water, frightful
as death,&mdash;her hands are chains stronger than iron,
and her whole being is as much to be dreaded as an
army!</p>

<p>Could not she, brown as she was, almost black beside
the white-skinned blondes, domineer over the pale-faced
Livette&rsquo;s lover, if she chose? Indeed, what more need
she do, to make him unfaithful to his fair fianc&eacute;e, than
show herself to him, and could she not do it without
seeming to intend it? As she had, beyond question, been
insulted by this Christian, she could pretend to forget
her nudity in her wrath, and thus attack him with that
same nudity!&mdash;No, no, there was no need of philters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
magic incantations, or fires lighted at night when the
moon is young, under tripods on which marsh-water,
filled with snakes, is boiling&mdash;no need of such things to
bewitch this fellow! She would come forth from the
water, naked and lovely as she was, and the devil, at
her command, would do the rest! What were the
stones she might throw at a young man, compared with
the power that exhaled from herself? Yes, therein
lay the charm of charms. She knew it,&mdash;being a witch
like every other woman! Lust for her body was what
she would throw at him like an evil destiny; with
that she would poison his life&mdash;and then, she would
calmly watch the ravages of the poison.</p>

<p>And so she had come forward, small but formidable&mdash;the
queen! She knew also that in former times, in the
days of pagan Europe, an immortal goddess had issued
from the sea, had sprung forth, fair and naked, like
a marvellous flower, and, standing on the blue waves,
her feet resting in a shell of mother-of-pearl, had long
held sway over men&mdash;before the reign of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Renaud, turning in his saddle, saw the gipsy standing
there, still naked, waving her arms in the sunlight, as if
she wished still, from afar, to hold Livette&rsquo;s betrothed
spellbound and fascinated by her beauty.</p>

<p>The sun disappeared below the horizon, and the naked
woman&rsquo;s figure, even more mysterious in the gathering
twilight, was outlined in black against a coppery red sky.</p>

<h2><a name="chap08" id="chap08"></a>VIII<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">ON THE BENCH</span></h2>


<p>From Saintes-Maries, whither he went to ask how
many bulls he was expected to bring on the day of
the f&ecirc;te, Renaud rode away at once to the Ch&acirc;teau
d&rsquo;Avignon.</p>

<p>He was in haste to see Livette once more, and sitting
by her side to forget the scene of the afternoon, to which,
despite his efforts, his mind constantly reverted.</p>

<p>A ride of four or five leagues and he reached his
destination.</p>

<p>Livette and her father and grandmother were sitting
just outside the farm-house, enjoying the fresh air on the
stone bench against the fa&ccedil;ade of the ch&acirc;teau, among
the old climbing rose-bushes which frame the windows
above with their bunches of green leaves interspersed
with flowers.</p>

<p>This was also one of the favorite resorts of our lovers,
who liked to have above their heads the perfumed foliage,
to which one of the nightingales from the park
often came to sing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ah! good-evening, Jacques.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What brings you so late? You have dined, of
course?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ate some anchovies at the Saintes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re good for nothing but to give you an appetite.
Would you like something else? you have only
to speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Master Audiffret. I&rsquo;ll just go and look
after Blanchet in the stable and then come back. I
won&rsquo;t go to the <i>jass</i> to-night. I&rsquo;ll sleep in the hay-loft
with the horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Audiffret, with his pipe between his lips, rose
and followed Renaud as far as the door of the stable,
and from there watched him rub down his horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whenever you please, Master Audiffret, you can take
him back for Livette. I don&rsquo;t find any faults in him;
far from it. He is a good horse, and very gentle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is quiet with you because you tire him out, you
see; but she didn&rsquo;t use him every day, not by any
means; I am always afraid for her. If she takes a
fancy to ride him sometimes, you can lend him to her,
and take the first horse that comes along for yourself.
By the way, I hope you will soon have your Cabri
again. Somebody saw Rampal yesterday in Crau. He
was riding your horse, so he hasn&rsquo;t sold him, at all
events. It&rsquo;s fair to suppose he means to bring him
back to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh! I will go to meet him,&rdquo; said Jacques, &ldquo;for
as to thinking he will bring him back to me&mdash;oh! no;
he would have done that before now!&mdash;Can you tell me,
Audiffret, where Rampal was seen yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Between Tibert&rsquo;s farm and Icard&rsquo;s in Crau. Right
there, as you know, in the middle of a bog, is a hut
you can only get to by a plank walk built on piles and
covered by the water&mdash;you can only tell where it is,
when you know the place, by stakes sticking up at intervals
the whole length of the walk. I have an idea he
means to go in hiding there, the beggar, like the deserter
who went there to pass his time of service&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha! he has gone to the Conscript&rsquo;s Hut, has he?
Very good; I will go to see him there, never fear!&rdquo;
said Renaud.</p>

<p>Blanchet, having been well rubbed down, was grinding
the good lucern between his teeth. Renaud went out
of the stable, and with Audiffret sat down beside Livette
and the grandmother.</p>

<p>All four kept silence for a long moment. Nothing
could be heard but the unceasing, melancholy
croaking of the frogs, and beneath it, but indistinguishable,
the dull murmuring of the two Rh&ocirc;nes and
the sea.</p>

<p>The sky was swarming with innumerable tiny stars,
which seemed to answer the various noises of the palpitating
moor; and, just as the waters of the Rh&ocirc;ne,
after it rushes into the blue ocean, pursue their own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
course for a long while therein, unmingled, without losing
their earthy color; so the Milky-Way, made of a dust
of stars, pursued its course, easily distinguishable, through
the ocean of starry worlds.</p>

<p>Renaud had a feeling of constraint.</p>

<p>When he joined his fianc&eacute;e, he did not feel all that he
ordinarily felt&mdash;a joyful impulse to run to meet her, a
sort of oppression at the pit of the stomach, a sudden
delicious rush of the blood to the throbbing heart!&mdash;And
Livette, too, so soon, was conscious of a vague
inexplicable feeling at the bottom of her heart that
something was wrong. There was something between
them! Indeed, he had, for the first time, something to
conceal from her; and, thinking that it might, that it
must be apparent, he suddenly said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not well to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out for the fever!&rdquo; said Audiffret. &ldquo;I know
it is not as frequent or as dangerous as it used to be,
but you must be on your guard, all the same! Be on
your guard, and take the remedy. Up in the pharmacy
of the ch&acirc;teau are the registers of the time the land was
first exploited&mdash;the time when the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon
people were gaining a little arable land from the swamps
every day. Why, men went to the hospital, fifteen,
twenty a day. And such doses of quinine, my children!
It is all written down in the <i>Livre de Raison</i> up
there. In those days, all the farms hereabout had the
same kind of a book, called by the same name, just as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
sailors have a log-book. Those were the days of good
order and gallantry. The peasant-women in those days
didn&rsquo;t try to copy Parisian bourgeoises,&mdash;eh, grandmamma?&mdash;by
wearing dresses that didn&rsquo;t suit them,
instead of the old-fashioned gowns that made them
attractive because they were so becoming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sighed the grandmother, &ldquo;this is the age of
pride, and my time has gone by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is the common remark of all our old peasants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;People didn&rsquo;t read so many newspapers in those
days,&rdquo; continued Audiffret, &ldquo;they didn&rsquo;t worry so much
about the affairs of the whole world, and every man paid
much more attention to his own affairs. Things went
better for it. Landowners lived on their estates and
raised families, instead of going to Paris and dying
there, of pride or debt or something else. The <i>Livre
de Raison</i> up yonder describes our ancestors&rsquo; battles
with the swamps and the fever. The pharmacy is still
in good order, with the scales and the jars in the pigeon-holes,
under the dust. And the book tells everything,
diseases and deaths. To-day, hardly any one dies of the
fever in our neighborhood. It is dying out. The dikes
and canals have done good service, and this Cochin
China of France, as that sailor called it that I took to
see the Giraud rice-fields, this Camargue of ours is as
healthy to-day as Crau!&mdash;However, be on your guard, I
tell you, and take the remedy! don&rsquo;t wait till to-morrow;
Livette will give you what you need. Now, I am going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
to bed. Stay up a little longer, young people, if you
choose. Are you coming, grandma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll stay out a moment longer with the young
folks,&rdquo; said the old woman.</p>

<p>Audiffret knocked the ashes out of his pipe against
the corner of the bench, and having put it in his pocket,
went up to bed.</p>

<p>Silence reigned upon the bench.</p>

<p>The grandmother was tired and sleepy: every little
while she would raise her head as if suddenly awakened,&mdash;then
it would begin to fall forward again, slowly,
slowly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A heavy dew is falling,&rdquo; observed Livette, suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, demoiselle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; said she ingenuously, holding out her arm so
that he could feel the dampness on the sleeve of her
dress. But he did not put out his hand. He was not
all Livette&rsquo;s that evening, as usual. Strangely enough,
she did not frighten him that evening. He was not, as
usual, overcome with diffidence in her presence. She
no longer dominated him. And he was angry with
himself. He suffered. He realized that his thoughts
were more frequently busied with the memory of the
day than with his sweetheart, who was sitting so near
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo; said Livette, who
had had her eyes upon him for a moment past, as if she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
could see his face distinctly, although they were sitting
in the shadow. Beyond question, she felt that his
thoughts were elsewhere. There is nothing more subtle
than a lover&rsquo;s divination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am thinking,&rdquo; said Renaud, a long minute after
the question, &ldquo;about my horse, which I propose to take
back from Rampal to-morrow if he can be found in
Camargue or Crau.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; he repeated&mdash;&ldquo;I was thinking of the
Conscript&rsquo;s Hut, where he is at this moment, perhaps,&mdash;in
hiding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And of what else?&rdquo; Livette insisted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! how do I know! of the fever&mdash;of all we have
just been saying&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said the maiden, &ldquo;and not at all of me,
Renaud? do you not think of me any more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice was sad.</p>

<p>He shuddered, and the movement did not escape the
little one&rsquo;s notice. It seemed to him, as Livette uttered
that reproach, that he saw the gipsy again as he had
seen her in the afternoon, standing before him, near at
hand, all naked and so brown! as if she were accustomed
to pass her days naked in the sun, and were
tanned from head to foot by his rays. And how lithe
and sinewy the wild creature was! A genuine animal,
a little Arabian mare, of much finer breed than the

fidelity to his fianc&eacute;e, he had been as virtuous as a girl,
and now the hot-blooded fellow&rsquo;s continence was taking
its revenge upon him, a cruel revenge, arousing mad,
amorous longings that were not for Livette. And so his
very respect for her&mdash;poor child!&mdash;turned against her!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jacques?&rdquo; said Livette, in the hardly audible tone
the sentiment of love imparts to the lover&rsquo;s voice, a soft,
veiled tone, heard by the heart rather than by the ear.</p>

<p>Renaud did not hear her. He <em>saw</em>.&mdash;He saw the
gipsy as plainly as if she were there before him, even
more plainly. In the darkness of the night, her body,
brown as before, seemed luminous, like an opaque substance
giving forth a pale light. Her naked figure,
obscure and bright at the same time, was standing motionless
before his eyes&mdash;then it moved&mdash;and he fancied
that he saw the gipsy bathing in the phosphorescent
water peculiar to the summer months,&mdash;when swimmers
cause a cold, liquid light to dart hither and thither
through the dark water, following and marking the
outlines of their forms, from which it seems to radiate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I the fever?&rdquo; he said to himself.</p>

<p>As if in answer to the unspoken question, Livette
took his hand. She felt it from wrist to finger-ends,
to see if it were dry and hot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you must look out; father was
right, you have a touch of fever. Come up and find
the medicine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said he, glad of the diversion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;but move softly: grandma
has fallen asleep!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old lady was asleep, as she said. She was leaning
against the wall, perfectly motionless. The white
handkerchief, tied in the Arlesian fashion, instead of
covering her <i>chignon</i> only, enveloped almost her whole
head, allowing two tufts of coarse, white hair, all in
disorder, to protrude, like mist, on each side of her face.</p>

<p>She was asleep, her mouth partly open, a ray of light
shining through upon her teeth, which were still beautiful.</p>

<p>They left her there.</p>

<h2><a name="chap09" id="chap09"></a>IX<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE PRAYER</span></h2>


<p>Livette opened the farm-house door, which creaked
loudly in the resonant emptiness of the spacious stone
staircase.</p>

<p>She lighted the lamp, which was hanging on a nail,
and they went up-stairs together, she absorbed by thoughts
of him, and he of her, but no longer in their accustomed
condition of affectionate embarrassment.</p>

<p>He held the iron lamp, hanging at the end of its
hooked stick; and to relieve his conscience, to do his
duty as a lover, and perhaps in that way to change the
current of his thoughts, perhaps to set at rest the amorous
anxiety with which he was assailed,&mdash;to force himself
to return, heart and soul, to Livette, and, who
knows?&mdash;so hard to fathom is man with his background
of devil!&mdash;perhaps, with her and unknown to her, to
satisfy to some extent the passion kindled by the other&mdash;for
all these reasons together, more inextricably mingled
than the twigs of the climbing rose-bushes, he said to
himself: &ldquo;I will kiss her!&rdquo; He had never done that
thing,&mdash;except in the presence of the old people,&mdash;but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
the Renaud of that evening was not the Renaud
of other days, in his feeling for Livette. The powerful
leaven of his wild nature was swelling his veins to bursting.
In very truth, he had the fever,&mdash;at all events, a
species of fever. All his nerves were overstrained; in his
eyes, even the most indifferent objects wore an unusual
look. And in Livette he saw, in spite of himself, reproaching
himself bitterly therefor, things which ordinarily
he refused to see. And as, being always dressed
in the Arlesian fashion, she wore the <i>fichu</i> of white
muslin crossed upon her breast so low as to afford a
glimpse, beneath the gold chain and cross, of the white
throat, above the meeting of the stiff folds, laid neatly
one upon another, his passionate gaze fell upon that
spot, amid the modest arrangement of muslin, prettily
called &ldquo;the chapel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his left hand was the lamp, which he held shoulder-high,
and as far away as possible, to avoid the drops of
oil,&mdash;and he wound his right arm about Livette&rsquo;s waist
as she placed her hand upon the iron rail.</p>

<p>At every step they climbed, he felt the play of the
muscles of his fianc&eacute;e&rsquo;s youthful frame, imparting to
the arm about her waist a soothing languor that ran
through his whole being,&mdash;and yet his heart did not
rejoice thereat; and he realized that, ordinarily, if the
end of the velvet ribbon in Livette&rsquo;s head-dress touched
his face, it caused a sweeter thrill of pleasure in his
blood, and more than all else, a pleasure which there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
was no mistaking. And, thereupon, he grew vexed with
himself as for a failure of duty, he was oppressed by a
presentiment of disaster, vague but inevitable. And
she felt more and more keenly the rebound of his emotions.
She was conscious that her peace of mind was
endangered. Something certainly was against her. The
arm, which had sometimes been about her waist as now,
no longer seemed to be her lover&rsquo;s arm, but a mere ordinary
man&rsquo;s. She suffered, and did not understand. The
look she saw in his eyes was a strange look from him,
without affection, without pity even. She knew him
well, honest Renaud, her promised husband, and yet she
was afraid of him as of a stranger!</p>

<p>All these thoughts passed very quickly through their
minds, the more quickly because they were simply conscious
of them, and did not stop to try to analyze
them. The all-powerful human electricity, less known
than the other variety, was playing its game, impossible
to follow, in their hearts, with its vast net-work of currents
and connections. In these two creatures of instinct, the
ever-recurring prodigy of love, of natural affinity&mdash;of
the sympathies and their opposite&mdash;was seen once more,
as mysterious, as marvellous, as profound as ever. So
far as nature is concerned, there are two beings: man
and woman; there are no subdivisions. At the basis
of humanity, all life is the same, all passion is the same.
The student of the higher races labors incessantly to
perfect his reasoning and his powers of expression, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
there is more overflowing, complicated life in the heart
of his ignorant brother than in the heads of the philosophers,
who, by dint of self-analysis, have lost the
faculty of emotion. They who deem themselves most
skilful in discovering the real man in themselves, do not
perceive that they pervert the secret impulses of their
hearts by keeping too close a watch upon them. The
light of their miner&rsquo;s lamp changes the psychological
conditions, just as constant light would modify the physiological
condition of human beings and plants. And,
meanwhile, love and death repeat, in the eternal darkness
of their simple hearts, their unwitnessed miracles.</p>

<p>They had reached the landing on the first floor&mdash;as
large as an ordinary room. At the last step, Renaud,
almost lifting Livette to the landing, tried to draw her
to him, but she was seized with an impulse to resist, and
he with a sudden impulse to resist himself; separately,
the two impulses would have had no effect; but combined,
they exerted sufficient force to place an obstacle
between them, as if by mutual consent. That force was
the witchery at work.</p>

<p>As they did not exchange a word, their embarrassment
increased.</p>

<p>Hastily, to escape the constraint each imposed upon
the other, she ran to the door at the right and entered.
And he, well pleased to be able to do or say something
to bring them nearer together, called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait for the light, Livette! I am coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
But Livette had suddenly remembered the gipsy&rsquo;s
threat. &ldquo;It is fate,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;I see it
now!&rdquo; And she felt herself grow pale.</p>

<p>Then she had an inspiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow me, Renaud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They passed through rooms where furniture of the
time of the Empire was sleeping beneath its covers,
and the long hangings falling from the ceiling in broad,
stiff folds, and withered, as it were, by time; rooms
seldom visited by the master, but kept in order by
Livette and her grandmother.</p>

<p>At last, Renaud and Livette reached an apartment with
bare, whitewashed walls, once used as a chapel.</p>

<p>A wooden altar, entirely devoid of fittings and ornament,
stood at one end of the room. Before the white
and gold door of the tabernacle the sacred stone was
missing, leaving a square hole in the wood-work of the
altar.</p>

<p>But Livette opened a broad door flush with the wall.
It opened into a closet in the wall. When the door
was thrown wide open, they could see, below a shelf
about level with their heads, chasubles and stoles hanging
straight and stiff&mdash;with great crosses in heavy gold
embroidery&mdash;suns from which the dove came forth;
and mystic triangles, and <i>Agnus Deis</i>. Among all the
others were vestments for use in mourning ceremonies,&mdash;black,
with bones and executioners&rsquo; ladders, hammers
and nails, in heavy white embroidery; and&mdash;to Livette&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
amazement&mdash;there, in the centre of a stole, on silk as
black as night, was worked a crown of thorns in silver,
which, in the lamplight, seemed to emit bright rays.</p>

<p>On the shelf, above all these priestly vestments&mdash;which
were arranged with the backs outward, hung in such
fashion that you seemed to be looking at the priests
standing at the altar&mdash;on the shelf, between the goblet
and the pyx, shone the consecrated host, a radiant sun,
mounted upon a pedestal like a candelabrum; and in
the centre of its rays was a gleaming circle of plain
glass, which also reflected, in fantastic guise, the flame
of the lamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kneel, Renaud!&rdquo; said Livette. &ldquo;Prayer is the
cure for what is happening to us. Kneel and let us
pray!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The drover obeyed. He understood that Livette&rsquo;s
purpose was to exorcise fate.</p>

<p>She prayed in silence fervently. He, marvelling,
unwonted to the attitude of prayer, and striving to keep
himself in countenance, looked from time to time at
the lamp he held in his hand, raised it to get a better
view of the ecclesiastical treasures, and, diverted for
the moment, by constant effort, from the perplexity that
weighed upon his heart, he was the more wretched when
his mind suddenly reverted to Livette.</p>

<p>Thereupon he said to himself that she certainly had
guessed the truth; that there was, in fact, a spell upon
him, and, in his heart, he implored the merciful God of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
the Cross, the mystic triangle, the symbolical bird and
lamb, to come to his aid.</p>

<p class="caption">In his left hand was the lamp, which he held shoulder-high,
and as far away as possible, to avoid the drops of
oil,&mdash;and he wound his right arm about Livette&rsquo;s waist
as she placed her hand upon the iron rail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who
trespass against us!&rdquo; Livette suddenly exclaimed, aloud,
thinking of the gipsy.&mdash;&ldquo;O God,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;we
promise Thee that on Saintes-Maries Day, which is near
at hand, we will each carry three tapers to their church,
and wait, until they are so far consumed, one after the
other, in their honor, that our finger-tips are burned!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she rose&mdash;but before they left the room, they
closed the unpretentious double door upon the objects
of a dead cult, left in the darkness of abandonment&mdash;the
goblet without wine, the pyx without bread, and the
consecrated host, whose polished metal case held naught
within.</p>

<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE TERRACE</span></h2>


<p>He was well aware that he needed no fever medicine,
and that his fever did not come from the swamps.</p>

<p>She said no more about the drug, but as they stood
on the landing and he was preparing to descend, she
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we go out on the terrace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Livette wished to prolong the t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, to ascertain
if, after her prayer, she would find <em>her</em> Renaud in him
once more.</p>

<p>He placed his lamp on the floor at the top of the
staircase, and, pushing open the door just above the last
step, they both stood on the terrace that overlooks the
whole ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>A square terrace, and in the centre the great bell lay
upon its side in its iron cage&mdash;the great bell, three feet
in diameter, that in the old days called to work as well
as to prayer, and when it rang the Angelus caused the
fever-haunted farm-laborers to fall upon their knees on
the brink of the miasmatic bogs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
Both of them, one after the other, mechanically struck
the bell with their foot, as it lay there on its side. It
gave forth a short, plaintive note, quickly stifled by
contact with the flag-stones. It was like the sigh of a
mystery-haunted soul.</p>

<p>With hearts as sad as the bell, they leaned on the
stone parapet in presence of the night.</p>

<p>Livette and Renaud loved each other, but affection
was no longer enough for him. The sap of the spring-time,
boiling in his veins in lustful desire, gave birth, in
Livette&rsquo;s heart, to sweet flowers of reverie.</p>

<p>The swarming of the stars above their heads was
beyond comprehension. They were as many as the
gadflies and frogs in the desert, or the waves of the sea.
They seemed to open and half close, like flowers in a
meadow, waved to and fro by a light, quickly-passing
breath, like eyelids making signs.</p>

<p>They seemed to have something to say, to move like
lips speaking a living language, telling of something of
great moment that must be known at once&mdash;but no
sound coming from them reaches the ears of men,
for human hearing is not keen enough. Nor is the
human sight keen enough to see that the dust of
the Milky-Way (pale as the pollen of flowers) is also
made of stars. Though men have seen it with a different
sight, afforded by man&rsquo;s inventive genius, that sight
is powerless to pierce farther and deeper&mdash;to learn all
there is to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
Moreover,&mdash;and Renaud himself had heard the story
from the shepherds who pass the winter in Camargue
and Crau, and spend their nights in summer counting
the stars upon the summits of the Alps,&mdash;there are, in
space, beyond the skies visible to our eyes, fires alight so
far away from us, so far away that their light, now on its
way toward our earth, will not reach us for centuries
to come. The men who follow us centuries hence will
see twinkling stars that even in our day were lighted
and making signs we could not see. And in those days
ideas, which are already kindled in men&rsquo;s minds, and
are seen to-day by none save those in whom their light
is shed, will shine for all, and one of them will be, for
every mortal, the love and pity of the world.</p>

<p>Certain it is, that neither Renaud nor Livette could
fathom those infinite depths; but from the vast expanse
of heaven, swarming with tiny lights, a nameless emotion
stole into their hearts, made up of all their hopes
to come.</p>

<p>Future worlds, lovelier than this of ours, were dreaming
in them, with them.</p>

<p>In them, too, because they were young and human,
there was a share in the future. In them, too, was the
responsibility for future lives. In them, too, lurked
the mystery of generations to be born, for whom a
single couple, surviving the wreck of the demolished
world, would be enough to bestow upon them the desire
to live and the power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
A spark is the basis of all fire. A man and a woman
are the basis of all love. Infinity is no greater than
the number two. And that is why the great scholars,
who figure like Barr&ecirc;me, know no more of life and
the heart than Livette and Renaud&mdash;who knew nothing
at all.</p>

<p>They knew naught save that they were alive and that
they wished to love each other and that they sought and
shunned each other at the same moment&mdash;but they did
not ask each other why. They said nothing. They
felt. They could not say to each other that rivalry and
jealousy, that is to say grief, serve the designs of nature,
whose purpose doubtless is, by arousing those emotions,
to quicken desire, so that creation may be assured by
outbursts of passion, and the future of mankind by the
imperious need of pleasure.</p>

<p>What does the law care for the weak and the vanquished?
the strong alone, they say, it wishes to perpetuate.</p>

<p>Pity and justice are human inventions, and will never
triumph until they have been slowly assimilated by the
human mind to the matter of which it is made.</p>

<p>They suffered, they longed for happiness&mdash;beneath
that mystery-laden spring sky. They awaited the coming
of their joy, they summoned their every hope, and
they gazed at the dark horizon, at the desert, where
the tracts of sand shone like mirrors among the dark
reeds, and the ponds glistening with salt between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
black lines of tamarisks. They gazed upon the boundless
expanse in which they seemed lost, and where,
nevertheless, they felt that they alone were an epitome
of everything; they listened, without hearing them, to
the unending noises of the island,&mdash;the murmuring
of the water, the rustling of the reeds, the waving
foliage, the growling of wandering beasts, the distant
roaring of two rolling rivers and a restless sea;&mdash;and
this combined voice of the whole island formed a
fitting accompaniment, by reason of the extent and
number of the sounds that composed it, to the silent
twinkling of the stars, that no one hears.</p>

<p>There was in the park, invisible to them at that hour,
a foreign tree, on which the flowers could be seen, by
daylight, opening with a slight noise. They sometimes
amused themselves by watching that tree, said to have
come from Syria. A slight report, as if muffled, and a
tiny cloud, of very powerful odor, would issue from the
bursting cell. The tree continued, during the night, to
send out its dust of passions in quest of prey, and its
strange perfume was wafted upward to the lovers.</p>

<p>They trembled with joy at the slightest contact with
each other. Ah! if she could but have given him, on
that beautiful May evening, all the love his lusty youth
demanded; if he could but have felt her clinging lips
melt beneath his burning ones, upon that lofty terrace
overlooking the rounded tops of the huge trees in the
park, beneath that dark star-spangled sky, doubtless his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
little betrothed would have remained sole mistress of his
heart!</p>

<p>But there were too many obstacles between Livette
and Renaud; and as he struggled virtuously to keep
away from her, his thoughts flew off to the other.</p>

<p>And Livette was already conscious of the heartache
of the deserted lover. All the broad expanse of level
country that her eyes knew so well, and that she felt
about her in the darkness, suddenly seemed empty to
her, a desert in very truth, and thereby to resemble her
own heart. And softly, silently, she began to weep,&mdash;whereupon
one of the great farm dogs, her favorite,
who had been seeking her in every direction, came up
to her and licked her hand as it hung at her side.</p>

<p>And down yonder, far down above the dark line of
the sea, Renaud, meanwhile, fancied that he saw a
naked woman&rsquo;s form emerge from the water, and await
his coming, suspended in mid-air, or standing on the
surface of the waves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Livette! Livette!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the grandmother&rsquo;s voice calling.</p>

<p>They went down without exchanging a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Monsieur Jacques,&rdquo; said the maiden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, mademoiselle,&rdquo; Renaud replied.</p>

<p>So they called each other monsieur and mademoiselle
that night, and, a moment after they had parted, Renaud
took his horse from the stable in perfect silence, and
rode away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
His heart did not tell him that Livette, at her window,
watched him depart, her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She followed for a moment with her glance the luminous
point (the reflection of a star upon the head of the
drover&rsquo;s spear) dancing about in the darkness among
the trees like a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp,&mdash;and when that spark
went out, she no longer saw the stars.</p>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11"></a>XI<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE HIDING-PLACE</span></h2>


<p>Whither he was going he had no idea. He rode at
random under the spur of the energy that was rampant
within him, demanding to be expended.</p>

<p>Love guided him as he himself guided his horse. He
was the rider of his own steed, and at the same time the
accursed steed of the passion that impelled him, spurred
him on, shouted to him: &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; guided this
way and that, without purpose, his mad race across
the moor. He, too, was mounted, harassed, bridled,
whipped, bit in mouth, raging and powerless. And the
horse shared the mad humor of his master, who was
under the spell of love, so that Blanchet, wearied
though he was by his day&rsquo;s labor, having had but a very
brief rest, was wild with excitement none the less. Fortunately,
he knew all the ditches and canals and bogs,
and, in his rapid flight with the reins lying on his neck,
he chose his own road. Sometimes he would slacken
his pace on approaching a ditch, in order to walk down
into it, head first, compelling his rider to stand in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
great stirrups, with his back touching the croup: sometimes
he leaped them at full speed.</p>

<p>Drunken, bareheaded,&mdash;his hat having blown away
somewhere in the darkness,&mdash;the wind whistling through
his hair, Renaud rode, for the sake of riding, because
the violence of his pace corresponded to the violence
of the passions that were raging within him. He tore
along as a beast does in the rutting season, from its mad
desire to be alone.</p>

<p>And he said to himself that it was abominable to
think of the other, when he had for his own that flower
of beauty, chastity and sweetness; but he was thirsting
for something very different; and he was conscious
of an intensely bitter taste in his mouth, a clinging,
dry saliva, a moisture that made his thirst the more
unbearable.</p>

<p>Powerless to devise a means of escape from all the
evil impulses in his heart, he rode on confessing to two
longings: either to meet Rampal and take vengeance
upon him for everything, or else to fall over backward
into a ditch and rise no more, thus giving a different
turn to his evil destiny;&mdash;and a third longing which he
did not admit even to himself: to meet the gipsy at
daybreak, begging at the door of some farm.&mdash;And
then?&mdash;He did not know!</p>

<p>Suddenly he thought that he heard a beating of hoofs
behind him, the echo of his own gallop; he turned and
saw&mdash;he saw in very truth!&mdash;pursuing him at full speed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
the naked gipsy, sitting firmly astride her saddle, man-fashion,
upon a shadowy horse whose feet did not touch
the ground.</p>

<p>She flew through the air, laughing in mockery as she
cried to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, coward!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said to himself that it was not real, but he did not
say to himself that it was a vision; he thought: &ldquo;It is
witchcraft!&rdquo; and fear seized upon him, fear as powerful
as his desire, and he fled from the image of her he sought.</p>

<p>He turned to look no more; he fled. He heard the
double gallop still: his own and the other&rsquo;s. He rode
through the transparent mist that hovered over the damp,
salt sand; and as he cut through those crawling clouds
it seemed to him as if he were riding through the sky,
above the higher clouds. In very truth, his brain was
wandering, for love will be obeyed, and his youthful
passion was like insanity.</p>

<p>Suddenly Blanchet&rsquo;s four legs, as he flew over the
ground, became motionless and rigid as stakes, and his
shoeless feet began to slide over an absolutely smooth
surface of clay, hard as iron and as slippery as if it had
been soaped. Swiftly the horse slid along, digging furrows
with his hoofs upon the polished surface, and when
he lost his acquired momentum, he stopped, tried to
resume his former pace, raised one foot and fell heavily
to the ground, exhausted, his mouth and nostrils breathing
despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
In an instant, Renaud, leaning on his spear, which he
had not let go, stood at his horse&rsquo;s head, struggling to
lift him up, and encouraging him with his voice. Blanchet,
supported by the rein in his master&rsquo;s hand, regained
his feet after two fruitless slides.</p>

<p>Renaud looked about: there was nothing to be seen
save darkness, the desert, the stars,&mdash;tatters of pallid
mist that strayed hither and thither, as if clinging to
a bush, a tamarisk, a clump of rushes,&mdash;and assumed,
from time to time, the shape of fantastic animals.</p>

<p>Renaud mounted Blanchet once more, but he was
moved to pity for him. And the horse, sometimes letting
himself slide upon his shoeless feet, his four legs
perfectly stiff, sometimes putting one foot before the
other, testing the ground, which was firm and hard
beneath his weight, but soft beneath his sharp, scaly
hoof, carried him at last away from the clayey tract.</p>

<p>Pity and remorse at once were awakened in Renaud&rsquo;s
heart by Livette&rsquo;s horse.</p>

<p>What right had he, the drover, to ruin the favorite
steed of his darling fianc&eacute;e in the service of his passion
for a witch?</p>

<p>So Renaud dismounted, removed Blanchet&rsquo;s saddle
and bridle, and said to him: &ldquo;Go! do what you will.&rdquo;
Then he cut a bundle of reeds with which he made himself
a bed, and lay upon his back, with his saddle under
his head and a handkerchief over his face, waiting for
dawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
He fell into a heavy sleep, during which his trouble
swelled and burst within him, forced its way out, and
took on form and feature.&mdash;The same vision constantly
returned.</p>

<p>When he awoke, two hours later, he found his cheeks
wet with tears and his hands over his face. Then he
took pity upon himself, and, having begun to weep in
his dream, he let the tears flow freely that he would
have forced back had they sought an outlet on the
previous day.</p>

<p>He deemed himself a miserable wretch, and wept over
his fate, at first madly, convulsively, and then with joy,
as if, in weeping, he had poured out all his sorrow forever.
He wept to think that he was caught, powerless,
between two contrary, irreconcilable things: that he
wished for the one, and thirsted, against his will, for the
other. He beat his hands upon the ground; he tore his
cravat, which strangled him; he ground the reeds with
his teeth, and cried aloud like a child,&mdash;he, an orphan:</p>

<p>&ldquo;O God! my mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he would have wept on for a long while, perhaps,
and emptied the springs of bitterness in his heart, had he
not suddenly felt a warm caress&mdash;two soft, warm, moist
caresses upon his cheek, his forehead, his closed eyes.</p>

<p>He half opened his eyelids and saw Blanchet standing
beside him, touching his face with his pendant lip as he
used to touch Livette&rsquo;s hand when in search of a bit of
sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
Another animal had imitated Blanchet; it was the
<i>donda&iuml;re</i>, Le Doux, the drover&rsquo;s favorite, the leader of
his drove of wild bulls and cows, whose bell he had not
heard, but who had recognized his master.</p>

<p>The compassion of these two dumb animals aggravated
Renaud&rsquo;s bitter grief at first. Like children, who begin
to howl as soon as you sympathize with them, he, when he
found he was so wretched as to arouse the pity of beasts,
cried aloud in his heart, but stifled the cry at his throat;
then, touched at the sight of their kindly faces, and distracted
thereby from his own thoughts, he became suddenly
calm, sat up, put out his hand toward the muzzles
of the powerful yet docile creatures, and spoke to them:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good fellows, good fellows! oh! yes, good fellows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Day began to break. And the great black bull and
the white horse, both, as if in answer to the man and in
answer likewise to the first gleam of returning day,
which sent a thrill of delight over all the plain, stretched
out their necks toward the east; and the neighing of the
horse arose, loud and shrill as a flourish of trumpets,
sustained by the bass of the bull&rsquo;s bellowing.</p>

<p>Instantly a chorus of neighs and bellows arose on all
sides of Renaud. His free drove had passed the night
in the neighborhood. He was surrounded by the
familiar forms of his own beasts.</p>

<p>They came at the call of Blanchet and Le Doux and
the drover&rsquo;s voice. The mares were white as salt.
Some of them came trotting up, some galloping, some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
followed by their foals; and passed their heads between
the reeds, peered curiously in, and stood there,&mdash;or else,
with a cunning air, set off again, as who should say:
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the tamer, let us be off!&rdquo; And there was a
great kicking and flinging of heels away from the man&rsquo;s
side.</p>

<p>Some bulls, thin, nervous black fellows, whipping
their sides with their long tails, also came up, took
alarm, remembering that they had been punished for
some shortcoming, and, turning tail, decamped in the
same way, and when they were out of sight, suddenly
stopped.</p>

<p>But as the <i>donda&iuml;re</i> remained there, few of the horses
and cattle left the spot.</p>

<p>Some, the oldest or the wisest, slowly assumed a kneeling
posture, as if to resume their interrupted repose,
then, scenting the approaching sun, wound their tongues
about the tufts of salt grass, drew them into their mouths
and chewed placidly, while the silvery foam fell from
their muzzles.</p>

<p>Others, in the same posture, lazily licked their sides.
A mother, nursing her calf, watched him with a calm,
gentle eye.</p>

<p>Here a stallion drew near a mare, reached her side in
two bounds, with tail in air and bristling mane, and
bold, sonorous, trumpet-like call&mdash;then reared, and when
the mare leaped aside, bit at her and with a sudden
sidewise movement dodged the kick she aimed at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
More than one bull, too, paid court to the other sex,
rose clumsily on his hind legs, only to fall again on his
four feet, with nothing beneath him.</p>

<p>The awakening of the drove was not complete. The
animals were still dull and heavy. They were awaiting
the coming of the sun.</p>

<p>Renaud approached a half-broken stallion he had
sometimes ridden, and threw over his neck the <i>s&eacute;den</i> he
had just coiled for that purpose&mdash;Livette&rsquo;s <i>s&eacute;den</i> and
Blanchet&rsquo;s, all stained with mud from having brought so
many beasts to earth.</p>

<p>He gave sugar to the wild creature, who allowed himself
to be saddled without overmuch resistance, desirous,
perhaps, to enjoy for a day the abundant supply
of hay in the stables of the ch&acirc;teau, which he had not
forgotten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go and rest, old fellow!&rdquo; said Renaud to Blanchet.</p>

<p>And he set off on his fresh steed, spear in hand, with
the idea of seeking Rampal.</p>

<p>The stallion he rode was his favorite, the one he had
named Prince. And he felt a thrill of honest satisfaction
as he said to himself that at all events Livette&rsquo;s horse
would not have to put up with his whims and follies
as a lover any more. He felt highly pleased at that
thought, being lightened of a threefold responsibility, as
rider, drover, and lover.</p>

<p>Prince seemed disappointed when Renaud compelled
him to turn his back on the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
He rode in the direction of the cabin mentioned by
Audiffret. It was very possible, after all, that Rampal
had taken up his quarters there, and he proposed to find
out. Now, as this cabin was, as we have seen, not in
Camargue, but in Crau, not far from the Icard farm, between
nine and ten leagues to the eastward, it was necessary
to cross the main stream of the Rh&ocirc;ne. But, in that
vast plain, men rode long distances for a <em>yes</em> or a <em>no</em>, and
thirty or forty kilom&egrave;tres had no terrors for Renaud.</p>

<p>From his present position, it seemed to him that his
shortest road would be to skirt the southern shore of the
Vaccar&egrave;s.</p>

<p>The cool, fresh morning air drove away all his black
thoughts, his visions and nightmares; he felt something
like tranquillity. Moreover, he was so overdone with
weariness that he seemed half-asleep, and the feeling
was delicious. He no longer had the strength to follow
his thoughts, still less to guide them, so that he was submissive
as a blade of grass, as any inanimate thing, to
the passing breeze, to the sun&rsquo;s rays.</p>

<p>The hour and the coloring of the earth and sky were
in very truth enough to rejoice the heart, and physical
gaiety took possession of him, as he had ceased to
reflect.</p>

<p>A fresh breeze, smelling of the sea, sent a shiver over
the water and the grass. The sun was rising. A moment
more and he would appear to cast his net of gold
horizontally over the plain. He appeared. The vague
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
murmurs became distinct sounds; reflection changed to
brilliant light, drowsiness to activity.</p>

<p>Renaud, who was galloping along with his spear resting
in his stirrup, his head leaning heavily on the arm that
held it and his eyes closed, under the influence of the
rocking motion of the horse, suddenly reopened them,
and looked about with the joyous glance of a king.</p>

<p>He paused a moment to gaze at a huge plough drawn
by several horses, which was transforming a wretched
stony field into cleared land ready for the vine.</p>

<p>The phylloxera, which has done so much harm in rich
and healthy districts, affords Camargue a new opportunity
to fight the fever and to gain ground on the
swamp. The sand is, in fact, very favorable to the vine
and very unfavorable to the parasitic insect, and this
watery country will gradually become, please God, a
genuine land of the vine!</p>

<p>Renaud watched the ploughman with a feeling of
delight at the thought of his native country being
enriched by honest toil; and with a confused feeling
of regret, too, for he preferred that the moor should
remain uncultivated and wild and free. The idea of a
flat plain, tilled from end to end, where no room was
left for the straying feet of horses as God made them&mdash;that
idea saddened him.</p>

<p>He would always say to himself as he rode through
more civilized regions: &ldquo;Now there, you know, a man
can neither live nor die.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
The fields of wheat or oats, even in the summer
season when they have such a lovely reddish tinge, so
like the overheated earth, so like the turbid, gleaming
waters of the Rh&ocirc;ne, had no attraction for him. They
gave him the impression of an obstacle that he must
ride his horse around, and Renaud did not recognize
the respectability of any obstacle&mdash;except the sea!</p>

<p>He was more inclined to look favorably upon the
vine, because it seemed to him that it was a glorious
thing for his country to produce wine, just at the time
when other districts in France had exhausted their producing
power. And then, the Rh&ocirc;ne, the <i>mistral</i>,
horses, bulls, and wine, all seemed to him to go together,
as things that told of holiday-making, of manly
strength and courage and joy. They knew how to
drink, never fear, did the men of Saint-Gilles and Arles
and Avignon. Renaud had attended wedding-parties
more than once on the island of Barthelasse in the
middle of the Rh&ocirc;ne, opposite Avignon, and there he
had tasted a red wine whose color he could still see. It
was an old Rh&ocirc;ne wine, so they had told him, and he
remembered that, being desirous to do honor to the
wine as well as to the bride, and being a little exhilarated,
he had solemnly thrown his cup into the
Rh&ocirc;ne after the last bumper. There are, at the bottom
of the Rh&ocirc;ne, many such cups, dead but not broken,
from which joy was quaffed but yesterday. They go
gently down, turning over and over, through the water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
to its sandy bed. There they sleep, covered with sand,
and two or three thousand years hence&mdash;who knows?&mdash;the
venerable scholars of that day will discover them, as
they are discovering amphor&aelig; of baked earth at Trinquetaille
to-day, and now and then beside them a glass
urn, wherein all the colors of the rainbow chase one
another about as soon as its robe of dust is removed.</p>

<p>Who can say that Renaud&rsquo;s brittle glass, from which
he drank the best wine of his youth, will not remain for
ages full of the sand and water of the Rh&ocirc;ne, and that&mdash;in
days to come&mdash;other youths will not find therein the
same delight? For everything begins anew.</p>

<p>Thus did the wanderer&rsquo;s thoughts wander from point
to point, from vine to glass. Ah! that glass of his,
thrown into the Rh&ocirc;ne! His mind recurred once more
to that memory of a debauch. It seemed to him now,
that, by throwing it into the river on the wedding-day,
he had foretold his own destiny, and that he, Livette&rsquo;s
fianc&eacute;, would never be married! He would drink no
more from the discarded glass.</p>

<p>The first impulse of delight that came to him with
the newness of the morning had already passed; his
sadness had returned as the day lost the charm that
attaches to a thing just beginning.</p>

<p>Dreaming thus, Renaud rode across the marshes,
Prince splashing through the water up to his thighs.</p>

<p>Yes, my friends, he forgave the vine, did Renaud, for
invading Camargue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
Moreover, after the harvest was gathered, did not the
red and white vineyards afford excellent pasturage for
the bulls? There are some that are all red in the
autumn, and others all white, or of a light golden
yellow&mdash;as if the vines had amused themselves by reproducing
the two colors of the wine under the gorgeous
sunsets. He has seen nothing who has not seen the
beams of the setting sun, in November, now yellow as
gold, now red as blood, spreading over a field of red
vines, over a field of yellow vines, which themselves
spread out as far as the eye can reach. Indeed, is not
Camargue the home of the <i>lambrusque</i>? The <i>lambrusque</i>
is the wild, Camarguese vine, different from
our cultivated vines in that the male and female are on
separate plants. The grapes that grow on the female
<i>lambrusque</i> make a somewhat tart but pleasant wine,
and the shoots of the vine make light, stout staves for
the hand.</p>

<p>Arrived at Grand P&acirc;tis, Renaud swam the Rh&ocirc;ne
three times, from Camargue to Ile Mouton, from Ile
Mouton to Ile Saint-Pierre, and from Ile Saint-Pierre
to the mainland.</p>

<p>He was now in the swamps of Crau, a stony desert
adjoining Camargue, which is a desert of mud.</p>

<p>To the eye these two deserts seem to join hands
across the Rh&ocirc;ne. From Aigues-Mortes to the pond
of Berre is a pretty stretch of flat country, my friends,
and the sea-eagle, try as he may, cannot make it less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
than twenty good leagues in a straight line! And that
is the kingdom of King Renaud.</p>

<p>Camargue has its saltwort, its grain and plantains and
burdocks, growing in small clumps, with sandy intervals
between; it has its <i>gapillons</i>, which are green rushes
split into bouquets, with thousands of sharp points finer
than needles; and here and there tamarisk-trees; and,
on the banks of the two Rh&ocirc;nes, great elms, so often
cut and hacked to procure wood to burn, that they
resemble huge caterpillars sitting erect upon their tails,
their short hair bristling as if in anger.</p>

<p>Crau is a land of naked plains and heather. It is, to
tell the truth, a veritable field of stones. They have
come, people say, from Mont Blanc, all the stones that
now lie sleeping there. The Rh&ocirc;ne and the Durance
have borne them down, then changed their beds, after
having jousted together on the vast space at the foot
of the little Alps. From beneath the stones of Crau,
in May, there springs a rare, delicate plant, the <i>paturin</i>,
or dog&rsquo;s tooth. The sheep push the stone away with
their noses and browse upon the slender stalks while the
shepherd stands and dreams in the wind and sun.</p>

<p>But this stony Crau is farther away, beyond the pond
of Ligagnou, which skirts the river. Here, in the Crau
that lies along the banks of the Rh&ocirc;ne, we are in the
midst of the marshes, which are dry during the greater
part of the year; some of them, however, are very
treacherous, and one should know them well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
Renaud rode in a northeasterly direction, and soon
reached the neighborhood of the Icard farm.</p>

<p>He drew rein.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the hiding-place?&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>And he tried with all his eyes to pierce the thick
underbrush of reeds, rushes, cat-tails, sedges, and bull-rushes,
springing from the midst of a deep bog. This
bog did not seem, to the eye, more formidable than
another, but the bulls and mares feared it and carefully
avoided it.</p>

<p>On the surface of the water was what looked like a
thick crust of mouldy verdure. It was not, however,
the leprous formation of duck-weed that lies sleeping
on our stagnant ponds. It was a sort of felt-like substance,
composed of dead rushes, roots, twined and
twisted weeds, which made a solid but movable crust
upon the water, swaying beneath the feet that ventured
upon it, ready to bear their weight for a moment and
ready to give way beneath them.</p>

<p>This crust (the <i>transta&iuml;&egrave;re</i>) was broken with fissures
here and there, through which the water could be seen,
dark as night, its surface flecked with transient specks
of light, gleaming like a mirror of black glass. Around
the edges, at the foot of the scattered tamarisks, grew
reeds innumerable in thick clusters, always rustling
against one another, and incessantly brushed, with a
noise like rustling paper, by the slender wings of the
dragon-flies with their monster-like heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
Many of these <i>can&eacute;ous</i> bear white flowers streaked
with purple. As they rise above one another on the
long stalks, you would take them for the flowers of a
tall marsh-mallow. These reeds, with their long leaves,
remind one of the <i>thyrsi</i> of antiquity, left standing
there in the damp earth by bacchantes who have gone
to rest somewhere near at hand in the shade of the tamarisks,
or to abandon themselves to the centaurs. They
make one think, also, of the wand of the fable, which,
when planted in the ground, was at once covered with
flowers, and thereby had power over marriages.</p>

<p>These <i>thyrsi</i> of the bog are reeds besieged by climbing
plants. The convolvulus fastens itself to the reed,
twines its arms about it, rises in a spiral course, seeks
the sunlight at its summit, and robes the long murmuring
stalk in brilliant and harmonious colors.</p>

<p>The sharp leaves of the young reeds stand erect like
lance-heads. The older ones break off and fell at right
angles. The delicate, graceful foliage of the tamarisks
is like a transparent cloud, and their little pink flowers,
hanging in clusters that are too heavy for the branches,
especially before they open, cause the flexible plumes
of the gracefully rounded tree-top to bend in every
direction.</p>

<p>Through the reeds and tamarisks Renaud sought to
discover the hut that he knew, and that Audiffret had
spoken of to him the night before. But he could hardly
distinguish the little inclined cross placed at the highest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
point of the roof of all the Camargue cabins, which are
built of joists, boards, grayish mud (<i>tape</i>), and straw.
The cabin was formerly entirely visible from the spot
where he stood, but the reeds had grown so thickly on
the islet on which it was built, that they completely hid
it. The path leading to it was on the opposite side of
the bog. He must make a wide d&eacute;tour in order to reach
it, the bog <i>de la Cabane</i>, so called, being of a very
erratic shape.</p>

<p>From the south side of the cabin he went around to
the north side. He no longer had the <i>transta&iuml;&egrave;re</i> in
front of him; but beneath the surface of the water, where
reeds and thorn-broom flourish, was the <i>gargate</i>, the
slime, wherein he who steps foot is quickly buried.</p>

<p>There are many other dangers in these accursed bogs.
There are the <i>lorons</i>, a sort of bottomless well found
here and there under the water, the location of which
must be thoroughly understood. The mares and heifers
know them and are clever in avoiding them, but now
and then one of them falls in, and now and then a man
as well. And he who falls in remains. No time for
argument, my man! You are in&mdash;adieu!</p>

<p>The drovers will tell you, and it is the truth, that from
every <i>loron</i> comes a little twisting column of smoke, by
which those mouths of hell can be located. A hundred
<i>lorons</i>, a hundred columns of smoke. There, my friends,
is something to dream about, is it not, when the malignant
fever, bred in the swamps, smites you on the hip?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
Renaud was anxious to know if Rampal was occupying
the cabin, but not to attack him there, for it is a
treacherous spot. &ldquo;If he is there, he will come out
some time or other. I will wait for him on the solid
ground. Ah! I see the path!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a winding path hiding under a sheet of shallow
water. The bed of the path was of stones, very narrow
but very firm, the right edge being marked, as far as the
cabin, by stakes at short intervals, just on a level with
the water.</p>

<p>Renaud dismounted, and looked for the first stake,
holding his horse by the rein. Although he knew its
location, it took him some time to find it. With the end
of his spear he put aside the grass, and when he discovered
the stake, he felt for the solid road whose width
it measured. Bending over, he gazed long and very
closely at the grasses and the reeds, which met in places
above the concealed pathway, and when he rose he was
certain that it had not been used for some time.</p>

<p>He was not mistaken. In truth, Rampal was a little
suspicious of that hiding-place, which was too well
known, he thought, and to which he could easily be
traced. He often slept in the neighborhood, ready to
take refuge in the <i>cul-de-sac</i>, if it should become necessary,
but he preferred, meanwhile, to feel at liberty,
with plenty of open space about him.</p>

<p>Renaud remounted Prince, and crossed the Rh&ocirc;ne
again an hour later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
That night he lay in one of the great cabins which
serve as stables&mdash;winter <i>jasses</i>&mdash;for the droves of mares,
in those months when the weather is so bad that the
bulls can find no pasturage except by breaking the ice
with their horns.</p>

<p>The next day, an hour before noon, he saw before
him the church of Saintes-Maries standing out like a
lofty ship against the blue background of the sea.</p>

<p>Little black curlews were flying hither and thither
around it, mingled with a flock of great sea-gulls with
gracefully rounded wings.</p>

<p>A cart was moving slowly over the sandy road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, Renaud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, Marius. Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To carry fish to Arles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marius raised the branches which apparently made up
his load, but which were simply used to shade a dozen
or more baskets and hampers. Well pleased with his
freight, he put aside the cloth that was spread over his
treasure under the branches. Baskets and hampers were
filled to the brim with fish taken in the ponds and the
sea. There were mullet and bream, still alive, animated
prisms with mouths and gills wide open like bright red
marine flowers amid a mass of dark-blue, olive-green,
and gleaming gold. There were enormous eels, too,
caught for the most part in the canals of Camargue,
which are veritable fish-preserves.</p>

<p>The dark-hued, slippery creatures twisted in and out,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
tying and untying endless slip-knots with their snake-like
bodies. By the livid spots upon some of the great eels,
Renaud recognized them as <i>mur&aelig;n&aelig;</i>, possessors of voracious
mouths, well stocked with sharp teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See how they all keep moving!&rdquo; said Marius.</p>

<p>At that moment, as if to justify his words, a great flat
fish flapped out of one of the baskets and fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>With the end of his three-pronged spear the mounted
drover nailed him to the earth to prevent his leaping
into the ditch, filled with water, that ran along the
road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; said he in surprise, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t that a cramp-fish.
When I spear one of them with my regular fish-spear,
which is longer than this three-pronged one, it
gives me a shock I didn&rsquo;t feel at all to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because the fish is in the water then, and
your spear is damp,&rdquo; said Marius, laughing. &ldquo;But let
the fellow stay there,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t worth
much. The snakes will have a feast on him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon, horseman and fisherman went their respective
ways.</p>

<p>The drover&rsquo;s thoughts wandered from the cramp-fish
and the <i>mur&aelig;n&aelig;</i> to the electric fish of America, of which
old sailors had spoken to him. They had told him that
it was charged with electricity like the cramp-fish, but
resembled the conger more in shape, and that it could,
with its overpowering current, kill a horse; in order to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
make it exhaust its stock of electricity, so that it can
safely be taken, it is customary to send wild horses into
the water against it; they receive the first shock, and
sometimes die from the effects.</p>

<p>As he rode on toward Saintes-Maries, Renaud mused
in a vague way upon the miracles of life, which there
is naught to explain.</p>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12"></a>XII<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">A SORCERESS</span></h2>


<p>Livette did not go to sleep. When Renaud had
passed out of sight in the darkness, she softly closed
her windows, and, throwing herself on the bed with her
face buried in the pillow, wept in dismay.</p>

<p>Meanwhile,&mdash;while Livette was weeping and Renaud,
bewitched, was galloping over the moor, fancying that
he was pursued by the gipsy,&mdash;the gipsy herself was
asleep.</p>

<p>The two beings whose lives she was beginning to
destroy were already suffering a thousand deaths, and
she, lying, fully dressed, under one of the carts of her
tribe, in their regularly pitched camp outside the village,
was sleeping tranquilly, her pretty, puzzling face smiling
at the stars of that lovely May night.</p>

<p>When Renaud left her, at sunset, all naked on the
beach, she had slowly stretched her sun-burned arms,
taking pleasure in the sense of being naked in the open
air, of feeling the caressing breath of the sea-breeze
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
that dried the great drops of water rolling down her
body. Then, still slowly, she had dressed herself,&mdash;very
slowly, in order to postpone as long as possible
the renewed subjection to the annoyance of clothes, in
order to enjoy unrestricted freedom of movement, like
a wild beast.</p>

<p>She had then walked along the beach, leaving the
imprint of her bare, well-shaped foot in the sand, covered
at intervals by a shallow wave that gradually washed
away the mark.</p>

<p>The last kiss of the sea upon her feet, to which a bit
of sparkling sand clung, delighted her. She laughed
at the water, played with it, avoiding it sometimes with
a sudden leap, and sometimes going forward to meet it,
teasing it.</p>

<p>She fancied that she could see, in the undulating folds
of the wavelets, the tame snakes which she sometimes
charmed with the notes of a flute, and which would
thereupon come to her and twine about her arms and
neck, and which were at that moment waiting for her,
lying on their bed of wool at the bottom of their box
in her wagon.</p>

<p>She had already ceased to think of Renaud. She
was always swayed by the dominating thought of the
moment, never feeling regret or remorse for what was
past,&mdash;having no power of foresight, except by flashes,
at such times as passion and self-interest bade her exert
it. Her reflection was but momentary, by fits and starts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
so to speak; and her depth, her power, the mystery that
surrounded her, were due to her having no heart, and,
consequently, no conscience.</p>

<p>The men and women who approached her might hope
or fear something at her hands, imagine that she had
determined upon this or that course, and try to defeat
her plan; but she never had any plan, which fact led
them astray beforehand.</p>

<p>She routed her enemies and triumphed over them, first
of all, by indifference; and then she would abruptly cast
aside her indolence, like an animal, at the bidding of a
passion or a whim, and would still render naught every
means of defence&mdash;her attack, her decisions, her clever
wiles, being always spontaneous, born of circumstances
as they presented themselves.</p>

<p>No: she made no plans beforehand, in cold blood;
she never concocted any complicated scheme; but she
could, at need, invent one on the spur of the moment
and carry it out instantly, at a breath,&mdash;or perhaps she
would begin to execute it in frantic haste, and abandon
it almost immediately from sheer <i>ennui</i>, to think no more
of it until the day that some burst of passion should
suddenly bring it back to her mind.</p>

<p>She was like a spider spinning its whole web in the
twinkling of an eye to catch the fly on the wing; or
she would spin the first thread only, and forget it until
something happened to remind her to spin a second.</p>

<p>Thus constituted, she was at the same time better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
and worse than other women, because she was more
changeable than the surface of the water,&mdash;because she
was of the color of the moment.</p>

<p>Being a fatalist, the gipsy said to herself that whatever
is to happen, happens, and she had never taken the
trouble to devise a scheme of revenge. She would
simply utter a threat, knowing well that the terror
inspired by a prediction is the first calamity that prepares
the way for others, by disturbing the mind and
heart and judgment. And then, something always goes
wrong in the course of a year, collaborating, so to
speak, with the sorcerer, and attributed by the victim
to the &ldquo;evil spell&rdquo; cast upon him. It is upon him, in
reality, because he believes that it is. In short, if opportunity
offered, she would assist the mischievous propensities
of fate, with a word, a gesture, a trifle&mdash;and,
if opportunity did offer, it was because it was decreed
long ages ago, written in the book of destiny that so
it should be!</p>

<p>A true creature of instinct, the gipsy had no other
secret than that she had none.</p>

<p>She followed her impulses, satisfied her desire for
revenge, her love or her hate, without stopping to consider
anything or anybody; and, like the wild beast,
she, a human being, became an object of dread to
civilized people, as nature itself is. Such creatures
are implacable. The gipsy loved life, and lived as
animals live, without reflection. It was the paltry yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
profound mystery of the sphinx repeated. Her actions
were those of a brute, not far removed from the
lower types of mankind, notwithstanding her lovely
human face, in which the eyes, like Pan&rsquo;s, not clear,
seemed veiled with falsehood because they were veiled
to their own sight with their own lack of knowledge,
their uncertainty and suspense. Look at the eyes of a
goat or a heifer. They are as deep as Bestiality, cunning
and strong, cowering in the shadow of the sacred wood.
Life longs to live. It is lying in ambush there. It is
sure of her and bides its time. The human beast not
only has more craft than the fox or tiger, but has the
power of speech as well. Nothing is more horrible
than words without a conscience.</p>

<p>After all, Zinzara was always sincere, although she
never appeared so, because her versatility placed her
from moment to moment in contradiction with herself.</p>

<p>The caress and the wound that one received from her
in rapid succession did not prove that she had feigned
love or hate. She did, in fact, love and hate by turns,
from moment to moment, or rather, without loving or
hating, she acted in accordance with her own fancy,
sincere in her contradictions&mdash;and very artlessly withal.</p>

<p>She bore some resemblance to the ape, as it sits among
the branches, softly rocking its little one in its arms with
an almost human air, then suddenly relaxes its hold and
lets its offspring fall, forgotten, to the ground, in order
to pluck a fruit that hangs near by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
She was a personage of importance in her own eyes,
and she saw nobody but herself at all times and under
all circumstances.</p>

<p>The gipsy was formidable, as a spirit concealed in an
element whose slave it should be. She had the force of
a thunderbolt, of an earthquake, of any fatal occurrence
impossible to foresee or to ward off.</p>

<p>The viper is not evil-minded. He does not prepare
his own venom. He finds it all prepared. Disturb
him, and he bites before he makes up his mind to
do it.</p>

<p>Like the cramp-fish or the electric eel, the gipsy
could discharge a fatal current of electricity as soon as
you approached her,&mdash;by virtue of the very necessity of
existence. It might happen to her also to indulge in
the sport of exerting her malignant power around her,
for no reason, simply to watch its effects, because it was
her day and her hour, her whim.</p>

<p>She had the same means of defence and amusement.</p>

<p>It was not in her nature to be malignant. It simply
was not necessary for her to think of you, that was all.
As a matter of fact, a man was fortunate if she did not
look at him.</p>

<p>Although born of a race that holds chastity in high
esteem, she was not chaste; not that she loved debauchery
above everything else, but she used it as a means
of domination,&mdash;the more unfailing because she made
little account of it. Always superior, in her coldness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
to the passion she inspired, it was in that more than
all else that she really felt herself a queen, a sorceress&mdash;aye,
a goddess, by favor of the devil! The caress of
the water in which she bathed afforded her more pleasure
than it afforded others. She was like the female plant
of the <i>lambrusque</i>, which is fertilized by the wind.</p>

<p>Like the mares of Camargue, that often assemble on
the shore to breathe the fresh sea air,&mdash;when she opened
her lips to the salty breeze, on those fine May evenings,
she was happier than any man&rsquo;s kiss could make her.
The wandering spirit of her race breathed upon her lips,
in the air, with the freedom of the boundless waste&mdash;a
vague hope, vain and unending.</p>

<p>Being thus constituted, she knew that she exercised a
disturbing influence upon others, and that she was herself
protected by something that relieved her of responsibility.
That thought filled her with pride. There was
a reflection of that pride in her smile. There was also
the constant remembrance of the sensations she had
experienced, known to her alone, and a certain number
of men, who knew nothing of one another.</p>

<p>Their ignorance, which was her work, also made her
smile. And that smile was a mixture of irony and contempt.
She knew her own strength and their weakness.
So she was always smiling.</p>

<p>With no other policy than this, she reigned over her
nomadic tribe, changing her favorite, like a genuine
queen, as chance or her own impulses willed, but giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
each one of them to believe that he was the only man
she had ever really loved, even if he were not her first
lover.</p>

<p>To deceive the <i>zingari</i>&mdash;that was a notable triumph
for a <i>zingara</i>!</p>

<p>Among the fifteen or twenty children in her party,
there was a young dauphin, the queen&rsquo;s offspring; but
since he had left her breast, she had bestowed no more
care upon him than the bitch bestows upon her puppy
some day to become her mate.</p>

<p>When she came near her camping-ground, excited by
her recent contact with the waves and the salt, which,
as it dried upon her, pressed against her soft, velvety
flesh, the gipsy, tingling with warmth in every vein,
cast a sidelong glance at one of the male members of
the tribe, a young man with a bronzed skin and thin,
curly beard.</p>

<p>And, in the darkness,&mdash;when they had eaten the soup
cooked in the kettle that hung from three stakes in the
open air,&mdash;the <i>zingaro</i> glided to the <i>zingara&rsquo;s</i> side.</p>

<p>At that very moment, by her fault, two human beings
were suffering in the inmost recesses of their consciences,
where Livette and Renaud were gazing at each other
with eyes in which there was no look of recognition.</p>

<p>The betrothed lovers, her victims, were struggling
under the evil spell cast upon them by her glance, at
the moment that that glance seemed to grow tender in
response to that with which her lover enveloped her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
on the edge of the ditch, beneath the feeble light of
the stars.</p>

<p>Renaud at that moment was dreaming that he had
seen the naked gipsy again and triumphed over her,
and was asking himself, at the memory of that robust,
youthful form, if she were not a virgin, even though a
child of the high-road; recalling confusedly a strange,
overpowering, absolute passion, the triumphal possession
of a new being, a heifer hitherto wild and vicious,
even to the bulls; of a mare that had never known bit
or saddle, and had maintained a rebellious attitude in
presence of the stallion.</p>

<p>Renaud was dreaming all that, but Renaud no longer
existed for Zinzara.</p>

<p>Zinzara, just at that moment, in the dew-drenched
grass, was writhing about like the legendary conger-eel,
that comes out of the sea to abandon itself to the labyrinthine
caresses of the reptiles on the shore.</p>

<p>Two days Livette waited, wondering what was taking
place. Weary at last of seeking without finding, she
set out for Saintes-Maries on the morning of the third
day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;I may, perhaps, hear some
news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her father saddled an honest old horse for her use.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must go to Tonin the fisherman&rsquo;s at noon,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;and eat your <i>bouille-abaisse</i>. Send him word,
when you arrive, with a good-day from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
Livette, as she rode along, looked about her at the
peaceful green fields, joyous and bright in the light that
fell from the sky and the light that rose on all sides
from the water.</p>

<p>The gnats danced merrily in the sunbeams. When
the gnats dance, they furnish the music for the ball with
their wings, and on calm days there is a sound like the
strumming of a guitar on the golden strings of light
over all the plain. There were also in the air long,
slender threads,&mdash;the &ldquo;threads of the Virgin,&rdquo; or gossamer,&mdash;come
from no one knows where, which waved
gently to and fro, as if some of the fragile strings of
the invisible instrument on which the little musicians
of the air perform, being broken, had become visible,
and were floating away at the pleasure of a breath.</p>

<p>It may be that those threads came from a long distance.
It may be that the toiling spiders who patiently
spun them lived in the forests of the Moors, in Est&eacute;rel.
A breath of air had taken them up very gently, and now
they were on their travels.</p>

<p>Livette watched them floating quietly by, and thought
of a tale her grandmother had told her. According to
the grandmother, the threads came from the cloaks
spread to the wind as sails by the three holy women.
The wind, as it filled them, had unravelled them a little,
very carefully; and the slender threads, taken long ago
from the woof of the miraculous cloaks, hover forever
above the sands of Camargue, where stands the church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
of the holy women.&mdash;Above the strand they hover night
and day, as so many tokens of God&rsquo;s blessing; but they
are rarely visible, and if, by chance, on a fine day, you
do see them, it means that some great good fortune is
in store for you.</p>

<p>In the transparent azure of the morning sky Livette&rsquo;s
heart clung to each of the passing threads; but the child
tried in vain to acquire confidence,&mdash;her heart was too
heavy to remain long attached to the fleeting things.
She was afraid, poor child, and felt influences at work
against her that she could not see.</p>

<p>Alas! while the golden threads floated over her head,
the black spider was weaving his web somewhere about,
to catch her like a fly.</p>

<p>Still musing, Livette rode on, and could distinguish
at last, far before her, the swallows and martins soaring
above the steeple. They were so far away you would
have said they were swarms of gnats. And with the swallows
and martins were numberless sea-mews. This host
of wings, large and small, now dark as seen from below,
now bright and gleaming as seen from above, turned and
twirled and gyrated in countless intricate, interlacing
circles. Instinct with the spirit of the spring-time and
the morning, they were frolicking in the fresh, clear air.</p>

<p>It occurred to Livette to ride by the public spring in
quest of news, for it was the hour when the women and
maidens of Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer go thither to procure
their daily supply of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
As she entered the village, she noticed the gipsy camp
at her right hand, but turned her head.</p>

<p>At that moment, she met two women on their way to
the spring, walking steadily between the two bars, the
ends of which they held in their hands, and from which,
exactly in the middle, the water-jug was suspended by
its two ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is just the time for the spring,&rdquo; said Livette to
herself, and she followed them at a foot-pace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, mademoiselle,&rdquo; the women said as they
passed, for the pretty maiden of the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon
was known to everybody.</p>

<p>There was as yet no one at the spring. The two
women waited, and Livette with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you happen to be riding about so early,
mademoiselle? Are you looking for some one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am out for a ride,&rdquo; said Livette, &ldquo;and as it&rsquo;s the
time for drawing water, I thought I would stop here a
moment. My friends will surely come sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No more was said, and Livette, having nothing else
to do, looked closely for the first time at the carved
stone escutcheon in the centre of the high arched wall
above the spring. It is the town crest, and it is needless
to say that it includes a boat, a boat without mast
or oars, in which the two Maries&mdash;Jacob&eacute; and Salom&eacute;&mdash;are
standing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have often wondered,&rdquo; said Livette, &ldquo;why they
put only the figures of two holy women in the boat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
For haven&rsquo;t our mothers always told us there were three
of them? Were there three or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly there were three, my pretty innocent,&rdquo;
said the older of the two women, &ldquo;but Sara was the
servant, and no honor is due to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the third was Saint Sara, then there were not
three Marys, eh? But I have always heard it said that
the Magdalen was there, and that she went away from
here and died at Sainte-Baume.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, so she was, and many others besides! Lazarus
was in the boat, too, but when they were once on shore,
every one went his own way: Magdalen went to Baume,
and the two Maries and Sara remained with us. That
was when a spring came out of the sand, by the favor of
our Lord. When they built the church, they walled in
the spring in the centre of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith, they would have done well to leave the spring
outside the church!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why so? is the water spoiled by it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only good on the f&ecirc;te-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After so many years! And there&rsquo;s so little of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ought to have asked the saints to make it pure
and abundant. If we had all set about it with our
prayers, they would have done it for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One miracle more or less!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The miracles, my dear, are only for strangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that is just what we need, neighbor. If it
wasn&rsquo;t so, you see, strangers wouldn&rsquo;t come any more&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
without them what would the country live on? poor
we! Where are our harvests? Where are our wheat
and our grain, good people, tell me that? If it wasn&rsquo;t
for the saints, this would be a cursed country! One
f&ecirc;te-day a year, and the pilgrims&mdash;God bless them!&mdash;fill
our purses for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miracle days are only too few and far between.
We ought to have two f&ecirc;te-days a year!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you saying, you foolish woman? Two
f&ecirc;te-days a year! Mother of God! That would mean
death to pilgrimages. To keep the custom going, everything
must be just as it is and nothing change at all.
Our men know that well enough. Remember the visit
the Archbishop of Aix and those great ladies paid us
twenty years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And once more the story was told of the visit of the
Archbishop of Aix to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer twenty
or thirty years before.</p>

<p>On a certain 24th of May the archbishop arrived at
Saintes-Maries with several elderly ladies of the nobility
of Aix. But it so happened that that 24th of May was
the evening of the 25th! Anybody may be mistaken!&mdash;So
that, instead of being lowered at four o&rsquo;clock, the
reliquaries were raised again on that day, and when
monseigneur entered the church with his fair companions,
it was good-by, saints! They had already been
hoisted up at the end of their ropes to the lofty chapel,
amid the singing of canticles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh! well!&rdquo; said the archbishop to the cur&eacute;, &ldquo;they
must come down again for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cur&eacute; was about to obey, but a rumor of what was
going on had already spread through the village!&mdash;Ah!
bless my soul, what a commotion!</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the old villagers. &ldquo;They would lower
the reliquaries on some other day than the 24th, would
they? Why, if it is such a simple thing and can be
done so often, why do you make the poor devils from
every corner of Provence and all the rest of the world
come hurrying to us on a special day? No, no, it would
be the ruin of the country, that is certain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To make a long story short, the people of Saintes-Maries
took their guns, and under arms, in the church
itself, compelled the prince of the Church to respect the
sovereign will of the people of the town.</p>

<p>And they did very well, for rarity is the quality by
virtue of which miracles retain their value.</p>

<p>One of the women having told this anecdote, which
was perfectly well known to them all, they began, as
soon as she had finished, to make up for their long silence
by loud talk, vying with one another in their approval
of the villagers&rsquo; revolt against the bishops, who would
have abused the good-will of the two Maries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are very lucky, all the same,&rdquo; said one of the
old women, &ldquo;to have a good well with good stone walls
instead of the brackish spring the saints had to get their
drinking-water from. I can remember the time when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
we got our water from the <i>pousaraque</i> (artificial pond),
as the people on our farms do to-day. The Rh&ocirc;ne
water that was brought into them through the canals
was always so thick and muddy you could cut it with a
knife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah! it had time enough to settle in our jars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is funny, though, to be so hard up for water in
such a wet country!&rdquo; said a young woman who had
just arrived. &ldquo;This water is a nuisance! Saint Sara,
the servant, ought to have known from experience that
a woman has enough work to do at home without wasting
her time waiting in front of closed spigots. Saint Sara,
protect us, and make them turn on the water!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The women began to laugh.</p>

<p>Almost all the housekeepers of Saintes-Maries had
assembled by this time. A last group arrived upon the
scene. Some carried jars, without handles, upon their
heads, balancing them by a graceful swaying of the
whole body. With their hands upon their hips, they
themselves were not unlike living amphor&aelig;. Others,
having one jug upon the head, carried another in each
hand&mdash;the stout <i>dourgue</i>, with handle and mouth; others
had wooden pails, others, glass jars, each having selected
a larger or smaller vessel, according to the necessities
of her household.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of a pot have you there, F&eacute;licit&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereat there was a general laugh.</p>

<p>She to whom the question was directed, replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
&ldquo;I broke my jug, poor me! And, as I had to have
some water, I took an old thing I found that has always
been standing behind the door at our house since I can
remember. If it will hold water, it will do for me
to-day, my dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it to monsieur le cur&eacute; for his library; it&rsquo;s an
antique, and is worth money!&rdquo;</p>

<p>F&eacute;licit&eacute; had, in fact, come to the spring with a genuine
Roman amphora, found in the sandy bed of the Rh&ocirc;ne&mdash;a
jar two thousand years old and hardly chipped!</p>

<p>Each family at Saintes-Maries is entitled to one or
two jars of water each day, according to the number
of its members.&mdash;The water had not begun to flow.</p>

<p>Livette, sitting upon her horse, thoughtful and sad
amid the chatter, was still awaiting her friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you saying just now?&rdquo; asked some late
comers.</p>

<p>And having been informed, each one of them proceeded
to expound her ideas upon the subject of the
saints and Sara the bondwoman, paying no heed to
what the others were saying&mdash;so that the jabbering of
the women and girls seemed like a <i>Ramadan</i> of magpies
and jays assembled in one of the isolated clumps of
pines so often seen in Camargue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to know if it&rsquo;s fair,&rdquo; cried one of the
women, &ldquo;not to put in Saint Sara&rsquo;s portrait, too! A
saint&rsquo;s a saint, and where there&rsquo;s a saint there isn&rsquo;t any
servant!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
&ldquo;The saints aren&rsquo;t proud! and Saint Sara cares mighty
little whether her picture&rsquo;s there or not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She may not care, but it was an insult to her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;good King Ren&eacute; and the Pope
knew what they were doing when they arranged things
so. Sara was Pontius Pilate&rsquo;s wife, and she was the one
who advised her husband to wash his hands of the
heathens&rsquo; crime!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A murmur of reproof ran from mouth to mouth
among the gossips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! here&rsquo;s old Rosine, she&rsquo;ll set us right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Motionless upon her horse Livette listened vaguely.
She was absent-minded, yet interested.</p>

<p>When old Rosine, who was very deaf, had finally been
made to understand what was wanted of her, and that
she was expected to give her views concerning Sara the
bondwoman, she began:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! my children, God knows his own, and Sara
was a great saint, for sure&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Rosine crossed herself, and was at once imitated
by all the old women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; added Rosine, &ldquo;Sara was a heathen woman
from Egypt, and not a Jewess of Judea; and the heathens,
you see, come a long way after the Jews in the world&rsquo;s
esteem. Don&rsquo;t you see that the Jews are scattered all
over the world, but they stay everywhere, and become
masters by force of avarice. That is their way of being
blessed by their Lord. But the heathens of Egypt, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
the contrary, are wanderers and poor, although they are
thieves, and more scattered and more accursed than the
Jews. Well, you see, my children, Saint Sara is their
saint, the saint of the Egyptian heathens! She wasn&rsquo;t
a very good Catholic saint, to pay the boatman for her
passage by a sight of her naked body&mdash;with the indifference
of an old sinner, I fancy! So it is right that
she should come after the two Marys, for there are
different ranks in heaven. And that is why Saint Sara&rsquo;s
bones are not between the boards of the great shrine in
the church, but under the glass of the little shrine in the
crypt&mdash;or the cellar, you might say. The cellar is a
good enough place&mdash;under the feet of Christians&mdash;for
miserable gipsies! And it is right that it should
be so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What Rosine says is true!&rdquo; cried one of the women.
&ldquo;These frequent visits of the gipsies are the ruin of the
country. When our pilgrims come, rich and poor, do
you suppose they like to find all these scamps, who are
so clever at stealing folks&rsquo; handkerchiefs and purses,
settled here before them? Don&rsquo;t you suppose that drives
people away from us? How many there are who would
like to come, but don&rsquo;t care to compromise themselves
by being found in such company!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah! such nonsense!&rdquo; said a humpbacked woman;
&ldquo;those who have faith don&rsquo;t stop half-way for such a
small matter! And those who have some troublesome
disease and hope to cure it here aren&rsquo;t afraid of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
thieves nor their vermin. Take away my hump, mighty
saints, and I will undertake to get rid of my lice and
my fleas one by one, without any assistance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This speech was greeted by a roar of laughter, which
stopped abruptly, as if by enchantment. The little gate
to the spring was opened at last, and, at the sound of
the water rushing from the pipe, all the women ran to
take their places in the line&mdash;not without some trifling
disputes for precedence.</p>

<p>At last, some of Livette&rsquo;s girl friends arrived. Spying
them at some little distance, she went to meet them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What brings Livette here so early, on horseback?&rdquo;
said the women, when she had moved away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s looking for her rascal of a Renaud, of
course!&rdquo; said the hunchback. &ldquo;That fellow isn&rsquo;t used
to being tied like a goat to a stake, and the little
one will have a hard time to keep him true to her,
for all her fine <i>dot</i>!&mdash;The other day, Rampal&mdash;you
know, the drover, a good fellow&mdash;saw him at a distance
on the beach talking with a gipsy who wasn&rsquo;t dressed
for winter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not dressed for winter? what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wore no furs, nor cloak, nor anything else, poor
me! She was taking a bath as God made her. The
plain isn&rsquo;t a safe place for that sort of thing. You think
you can&rsquo;t be seen because you think you can see a long
distance yourself, but a tuft of heather is enough for the
lizard to hide his two eyes behind while he looks.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
Again the women began to chuckle and laugh, but for
a moment only.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Livette&rsquo;s friends were saying to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t seen your sweetheart, my dear; but
they are already putting the benches in place against
the church for the branding, and he can&rsquo;t fail to be
here soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment, a strain of weird music arose not far
away. It was produced by a flute, and the notes, softly
modulated at first, were abruptly changed to heart-rending
shrieks. A strange, dull, monotonous accompaniment
seemed to encourage the sick heart, that called
for help with piercing cries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark! there are the gipsies and their devil&rsquo;s music,
Livette. Just go and look&mdash;it is such an amusing sight.
We will join you in a little while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about my horse?&rdquo; said Livette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t come to stay, there&rsquo;s a heavy iron
bracelet just set into the wall of the church to hold
the bars of the enclosure for the branding. Tie your
horse to that, and don&rsquo;t be afraid that he will disappear.
Every one will know he&rsquo;s yours by those pretty
letters in copper nails you have had put on your saddle-bow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Livette fastened her horse to the ring in the church-wall,
and walked in the direction of the gipsy music.
It seemed to her that she might probably learn something
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
Now, Zinzara the Egyptian had seen Livette ride
into the village, and her music had no other purpose
than to attract her, and Renaud, her fianc&eacute;, with her,
if he were there. Why? to see;&mdash;to bring together for
an instant, with no fixed purpose, upon the same point
of the vast world through which she wandered, two of
the personages with whom she &ldquo;beguiled her time;&rdquo;
to look on at the comedy of life, and to watch the
sequel, with the inclination to give an evil turn to it,
chance aiding. She loved the anomalies that result
from the chaotic jumbling together of circumstances.</p>

<p>Zinzara was turning a kaleidoscope whose field was
vast like the horizon of her never-ending travels, and
whose bits of glass, multicolored, were living souls.&mdash;She
turned the wheel to see what calamity destiny, with
her assistance, would bring to pass. The amusement of
a woman, of a sorceress.</p>

<h2><a name="chap13" id="chap13"></a>XIII<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE SNAKE-CHARMER</span></h2>


<p>Life is an enigma. The everlasting silence of space
is but the endless murmuring of invisible circles which,
twining in and out, part and meet again, lose and never
find one another, or are inextricably interwoven forever.
Life is an enigma. We can see something of its beginning,
nothing of its close; its meaning escapes us, but
all the links make the chain, and some one knows the
rest.</p>

<p>That there are two ends to the ladder is certain. Day
is not night, and one does not exist without the other.
There are joy and sorrow, health and sickness, happiness
and unhappiness, life and death&mdash;in a word, good
and evil, for the beast of flesh and bone. This is a
good man, that a bad. Religion and morals have
nothing to do with it, and afford no explanation; but
little children know that it is so, and fools know it likewise.
They who undertake to reason the thing out
learnedly, befog it. They who pull the thread break it.
There is some one and there is something. Nothing is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
null, I tell you, my good friends, and yonder drivelling
old idiot, sitting on the stone at the foot of the Calvary
before the church, and holding out his hand to Livette,
knows two things better than we&mdash;good and evil. The
idiot, when he passed the gipsies&rsquo; wagons in the morning,
talked amicably, yes, he talked for some minutes
with two or three gaunt dogs chained up under the
wagons; but when he saw Zinzara, the queen, fix her
eyes upon him, the idiot was afraid and limped away as
fast as he could. He was afraid because <em>there was</em>, in
Zinzara&rsquo;s look, <em>something not good</em>.</p>

<p>And now Livette, as she passes by, glances at him,
and the idiot&mdash;poor human worm&mdash;smiles and holds out
to her a glass pearl,&mdash;a treasure in his eyes,&mdash;which he
found that morning in the filth of the gutter near by.
The pearl glistens. It is bright blue. The idiot sees
beauty in it, and offers it to the pretty girl passing by.
Livette smiles at him, and he, the drivelling idiot, the
cripple who drags himself along the ground, laughs back
at Livette. He laughs and feels his man&rsquo;s heart vaguely
opening within him&mdash;why?&mdash;because of <em>something good</em>
in Livette&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>God is above us, and the devil beneath us. God?
what do you mean by God? Kindly humanity, which
is above us and toward which we are ascending; the
ideal, evolved from ourselves which, by dint of declaring
itself and compelling love, will be realized in our children.
The devil? what is that? the obscure beast, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
ravenous, blind worm, which we were, and from which
we are moving farther and farther away.</p>

<p>There is something nearer the mystery than the mind,
and that something is the instinct. Certainly we are
nearer to our origin than to our end, and instinct almost
explains the origin because it is still near at hand, but
the mind cannot explain the end because it is still so far
away! Whence come we? The crawling beast may
suspect.&mdash;Whither go we? How can the beast tell,
when he cannot fly?</p>

<p>The bond that binds us fast to earth is not cut. Man
bears forever the scar of his birth. He has, therefore,
always before him evidence of how he is connected with
infinity <em>behind</em> him; but how he is connected, by death,
with the life everlasting, <em>before</em> him, he does not see.</p>

<p>Instinct, like a glow-worm, lights up the depths from
which man comes forth, but intelligence casts no light
into the boundless expanse on high, wherein it loses
itself, just at the point where God begins.&mdash;Ah! how
mysterious is God!</p>

<p>Yes, between the intelligence and man&rsquo;s origin, instinct
stretches like a bridge. Between the intelligence
and man&rsquo;s end, there is a yawning chasm. The reason
cannot cross it. There is no way but to leap. Man
finds it easy to imagine what lies below; his own weight
draws him down to a point where he can understand it.</p>

<p>To understand what is above, it is essential to have a
power of lightening one&rsquo;s self, a wing which man has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
not. Here instinct acts upon the mind in a direction
opposed to mental effort.</p>

<p>To some minds this faculty of rising sometimes comes,
but man&rsquo;s conceptions depend upon his experiences, and
the time has passed when reliance was placed upon the
&ldquo;wise men,&rdquo; upon those whose conceptions far outran
their experiences. Perhaps it is better so. Perhaps
every man ought to form his ideas for himself and no
one will know anything <em>for good and all</em> until he has
earned the right.</p>

<p>Sometimes, for a moment, especially in dreams, but
occasionally in his waking hours, man <em>knows</em>. He has
profound intuition; but nothing is more fleeting than
this sudden glimpse of eternity.</p>

<p>The best of us are blind men haunted by the memory
of a flash of light.</p>

<p>Which of us has not known, by personal experience,
how a man can fly away from himself? The sense of
mystery, scarcely detected, has escaped us, but who has
not been conscious of it for a second?</p>

<p>Truth, like love, reveals itself for a second only, but
we must believe in it&mdash;forever.</p>

<p>These thoughts are properly presented here, for everything
is in everything. One man studies the hyssop,
another the oak; Cuvier the mastodon, and Lubbock
the ant, but they all arrive at the same point, a point
which includes everything.</p>

<p>Do you know why the gipsies, Bohemians, gitanos,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
zincali, zingari, zigeuners, zinganes, tziganes, romani,
romich&acirc;l,&mdash;all different appellations of the same wandering
race,&mdash;arouse such intense interest on the part of
civilized peoples?</p>

<p>There are two reasons.</p>

<p>The first is, that the gipsy, being very primitive and
wild, appears among civilized beings as the image of
themselves in the past. It is as if they were our own
ghosts.</p>

<p>When we see them among us, we amuse ourselves, in
the shelter of our established homes, by thinking regretfully
that we no longer have before us the broad plains
so dear to the beasts we are; that we are no longer in
constant contact with the earth, the plants, the animals,
which are the <em>mothers</em> that bore us, and whom we love
for that reason. They have remained what we were
when we left them, and that touches us.</p>

<p>The second reason is that they really discovered long
ago something of the meaning of life.</p>

<p>It is certain that they are magicians. They have seen
the hidden spring and have a vague remembrance of it;
they have retained its dark reflection in their glance.</p>

<p>The glance! they know its dormant and insinuating
power. They know how to subdue weak minds by a
glance.</p>

<p>The least skilled in magic among them still believe
that the &ldquo;secret&rdquo; of things is hidden away somewhere
under a stone, and in their travels through every country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
on earth they often raise heavy boulders, whose peculiar
shapes seem to indicate that they may conceal the
mystery. They never find under the boulders anything
but toads and snakes and scorpions, but they are skilled
at making powerful potions from the blood and venom
of the reptiles.</p>

<p>They know, also, the secret properties of plants, and
that the hemlock and belladonna vary in their effects
when cut at certain times of the year and at certain
hours, according to the influence of the seasons and
the moon&rsquo;s rays.</p>

<p>The gipsies are skilled in the science of poisons. Men
and women&mdash;<i>roms</i> and <i>juwas</i>&mdash;excel in the art of giving
diseases to cattle.</p>

<p>Their trades are only pretexts for calling at the houses
they pass. They are coppersmiths simply because the
art of subjecting metals to the action of fire was invented
by the son of Cain, the progenitor of all accursed
mortals. And they are saddlers because they like to be
about horses, dear to all vagabonds.</p>

<p>The gipsies, who were originally worshippers of fire,
and now have no religion of their own, but always adopt
that of the country they are passing through, are to
mankind what Lucifer is to the angels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We come from Egypt, if you please,&rdquo; Zinzara would
sometimes say to the people of her tribe. &ldquo;Indeed,
that is where we had our homes and were a powerful
race in the days of Moses. Then our ancestors were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
magicians to the kings of Egypt, who overcame death;
but our origin is higher and farther away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We come from a country where the <em>Secret Power
of the World</em> was discovered: a dragon guards the mystery
on the summit of a lofty mountain, in a cavern, out
of reach of whatever floods may come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our ancestor &Ccedil;oudra learned from the high-priests
the method of compelling the dragon to obey him. He
entered the cavern and conceived the idea of universal
knowledge, and resolved to avail himself of it in the
outside world, in order that he might become a king
and mighty among men&mdash;for why was he poor? Why
does poverty exist, why death?</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had no sooner conceived his project of justifiable
rebellion than the dragon sought to devour
him. Our ancestor eluded him, and believed that,
by virtue of the secrets he had discovered, he would
be omnipotent on earth, but suddenly he found that
he had almost forgotten them all, as if by magic. He
no longer remembered any of them except those that
do harm, those that produce disease, sorrow, misery,
and death&mdash;all the evils from which he would have
liked to free himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the high-priests cursed him and his sons.
Manou spoke against them thus: <i>They shall dwell outside
of cities; they shall possess none but broken vessels;
they shall have nothing of their own, except it be an ass
or a dog. They shall wear the clothes they steal from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
the dead; their plates shall be broken; their jewels shall
be of iron. They shall journey, without rest, from place
to place. Every man who is faithful to his duty shall
hold himself aloof from them. They shall have no dealings
except with one another. And they shall marry
only in their own race.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;And the <i>Tchandalas</i> were able to flee the country,
but not the sentence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that is our present case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The crown of &Ccedil;oudra is a broken ring&mdash;with sharp
points, like a dog&rsquo;s collar, and his sceptre is an iron
staff, broken but formidable. For why does want exist,
and pain and death? God is wicked!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this tale, set to music, the gipsy queen sometimes
lulled her son to sleep.</p>

<p>And when, at the entrance to some ch&acirc;teau, she cast
a long, malevolent glance upon a young mother, who,
upon catching sight of her, quickly carried her little
child within, such thoughts as these would run through
Zinzara&rsquo;s head: &ldquo;The secrets that are known to our
prophets, our dukes and princes and kings, will cause
all your cities, your churches, and your thrones to tremble
on their foundations, for why does want exist, and
pain and death? The hour will come&mdash;we await it&mdash;when
your nations will be scattered to the winds of
wrath, unless the wise men who invoked a curse on us
become their masters&mdash;but you are too far from their
wisdom for that! You will be ours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
&ldquo;Meanwhile, woe to those of you whom we find
alone! We look fixedly at them, and the spirit of evil
does the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And this is what little Livette saw when she approached
the gipsy camp.</p>

<p>The whole tribe was there. Their numerous wagons
were of different sizes, most of them being made in the
shape of small oblong houses, with little windows, very
like the Noah&rsquo;s arks made for children in Germany.
The gipsies had arranged their wagons side by side, in
a line, each one opposite a house in the village. Thus
the line of wheeled houses formed with the houses of the
village a winding street, which, if prolonged, would have
surrounded Saintes-Maries like a girdle. Thus, while
their sojourn lasted, the gipsies could cherish the illusion
that they were settled there, that they were inhabitants
of the village, one dwelling opposite the baker,
another opposite the wine-shop; but no one forgot that
the gipsy houses were built upon wheels that turn and
can make the tour of the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pity the tree,&rdquo; says the gipsy, &ldquo;it looks enviously
at me as I pass. It is jealous of my ass&rsquo;s feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most of the wagons were patched with boards of many
colors, picked up or stolen here and there.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the wagons of the tribe were
placed in the rear of the village houses, so that the
occupants of those houses, the innkeeper or the baker,
being busy in the front part of their establishments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
could naturally dispense with a too frequent appearance
in the gipsy street.</p>

<p>The nomads alone swarmed there undisturbed. They
passed but little time in the wagons, except when they
were on the road or tired or sick; their days were
passed in the open air, squatting in the dust, or on the
steps of the little ladders which they lowered from the
doors of their wagons to the ground; or else they
passed long hours lying in the shade under the wagon&mdash;smoking
their pipes and dreaming.</p>

<p>For the moment, some of the women here and there
through the camp were intent upon the same occupation:
searching, in the bright morning light, for vermin among
the matted hair of their children, whom they held tightly
between their knees as in a vise.</p>

<p>From time to time, one of the little fellows would
howl with pain, when his mother inadvertently pulled
or tore out one of his wiry, coal-black hairs. Then he
would wriggle and squirm to get away, but the vise
formed by the knees would nip him again and hold him
tight, and there would be a squealing as of sucking pigs
loth to be bled. Then blows would rain down and the
shrieks redouble. Suddenly the urchin that was howling
most lustily would cease, and follow, with a lively interest,
the movements of a chicken from some neighboring
coop, or the antics of a hunting-dog that had wandered
that way and was well worth stealing.</p>

<p>The mothers went through with their matutinal task
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
in an automatic way that said as clearly as possible:
&ldquo;It is of no use to try to do this, for the vermin breed
and always will breed; but we must do something. It
is always a good thing to be busy; and then it makes
an excellent impression, here under the eye of civilized
people. They see that we are clean and neat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buy my dog,&rdquo; said one of them with a leer to an
open-mouthed villager. &ldquo;You will be well satisfied
with his fidelity. He is faithful, I tell you! so faithful
that I have been able to sell him four times.&mdash;He always
comes back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All these women had a coppery, sun-burned, almost
black skin, and hair of a peculiar, dull charcoal-like
black.&mdash;Some wore it twisted in a heavy coil on top of
the head. Several of the younger women let it hang
in long, snake-like locks over their breasts and backs.
Their eyes also were a curious shade of black, very
bright, like black velvet seen through glass. Life shone
but dully in them, without definite expression. Some
mothers were attending to their duties with a child on
their back, wrapped in a sheet which they wore bandoleer-fashion,
with the ends knotted at the shoulder.
The little one slept with his head hanging, tossed and
shaken by every movement.</p>

<p>Red, orange, and blue were the prevailing colors of
their tattered garments, but they were tarnished and
faded and almost blotted out by layers of dust and filth;&mdash;a
smoke-begrimed Orient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
Many of the women had short pipes between their
teeth. The men who lay about here and there, with
their elbows on the ground, were almost all smoking
placidly, their Sylvanus-like eyes fixed on vacancy.
They made a great show of pride under their rags.
Some were asleep under the rolling cabins.</p>

<p>The line of wagons along the outskirts of the village
was still in shadow, but at the head of the line, the
first of the wagons, standing a little apart, beyond the
line of the houses, was in the sunlight. This wagon,
which was painted and kept up better than the others,
was Zinzara&rsquo;s, and a few of the villagers had collected
in the sunshine in front of it, attracted by the notes of
the flute and tambourine.</p>

<p>Livette, as she approached the group, had no suspicion
that, in the wine-shop facing the wagon, behind the
curtains of a window on the first floor, Renaud had
stationed himself, there, at his ease, to watch the gipsy,
who was playing the flute and dancing at the same
time, her feet and arms bare.</p>

<p>Zinzara held the flute&mdash;a double flute with two reeds
diverging slightly&mdash;with much grace, and blew upon it
with full cheeks, raising and lowering her fingers to suit
the requirements of a weird air, sometimes slow, sometimes
furiously fast and jerky. Her head was thrown
back, so that she appeared more haughty and aggressive
than ever.</p>

<p>As she played upon her flute, Zinzara danced&mdash;a dance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
as mysterious as herself. With her bare feet she simply
beat time on the ground. Her dance was naught but
a play of attitudes, so to speak. She constantly varied
the rhythmical undulations of her flexible, vigorous body,
whose outline could be traced at every movement beneath
the clinging material of her dress. When the movement
quickened, she stamped her feet faster, still without
moving from where she stood, as if in haste to reach a
lover&rsquo;s rendezvous, where languor would replace activity.</p>

<p>Seated a few steps from the dancer, a young gipsy,
with a vague, dreamy expression, was pounding with
his fist, thinking of other things the while, upon a large
tambourine, to which amulets of divers kinds were attached,&mdash;Egyptian
beetles, mother-of-pearl shells, finger-rings,
and great ear-rings,&mdash;which danced up and down
as he played.</p>

<p>And the tambourine seemed to say to the double
flute:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never fear: your mate is watching over you. I am
here, father or betrothed, I, your strong-voiced mate,
and you can sing freely of your joy and sorrow; no one
shall disturb you; I am on the watch, and for you my
heart beats in my great, sonorous breast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But to the gipsy&rsquo;s ear the music of the tambourine
said something very different; and with a smile upon
her lips, blowing into her flute with its diverging reeds,
raising and lowering her slender fingers over the holes,
Zinzara, exerting a subtle influence over all about her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
dressed in soft rags that clung tightly to her form and
marked the outlines of her hips and of her breast in
turn; displaying her tawny calves beneath her skirts,
which were lifted up and tucked into her belt,&mdash;Zinzara
seemed not to see the spectators.</p>

<p>Twenty or thirty people were looking at her, and
still she seemed to be dancing for her own amusement;
but her witch&rsquo;s eye followed, without seeming to do so,
the slightest movement of Renaud&rsquo;s head, the whole of
which could be seen at times between the serge curtains
with red borders, behind the windows of the wine-shop,
under the eaves of the house across the way.</p>

<p>When she saw Livette approach, the dancer beat her
feet upon the ground more rapidly, as if annoyed, and
the flute emitted a cry, a shrill war-cry, like the sound
made by tearing silk quickly.</p>

<p>Livette involuntarily shuddered, but she mingled
with the group, momentarily increasing in size, and
looked on.</p>

<p>Zinzara made a sign, and uttered some strange, guttural
words between two loud notes&mdash;words that were,
evidently, a precise command, for a gipsy child, who
had come to her side a moment before, glided under the
wagon, whence he emerged armed with a long white
stick, with which he motioned to the spectators to fall
back a little. Then he stationed himself in front of
Zinzara, in the centre of the first row of spectators,
and, turning toward them, enjoined silence upon them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
by placing his finger on his lips. The word was passed
along, and the bystanders ceased their conversation,
realizing that <em>something</em> was about to happen.</p>

<p>The dance was at an end.&mdash;The tambourine ceased
to beat time. The flute alone sang on in Zinzara&rsquo;s
hands, as her fingers moved slowly up and down.&mdash;Now
it gave forth a thin, clear note, like the prolongation
of the sound made by a drop of water falling
in a fountain; it was a sweet, insinuating appeal, as
melancholy as the croaking of a frog at night, on the
shores of a pond, at the bottom of an echoing, rocky
valley.</p>

<p>And, with the end of his wand, the child pointed
out to one of the spectators something that came crawling
out from under the wagon. It was a tiny snake,
with red and yellow spots, and it drew near, evidently
attracted by the notes of the flute. Another followed,
and soon there were several of them&mdash;five in all.</p>

<p>When they were in front of the flute-player, between
her and the boy with the wand, they raised their heads
and waved them back and forth, slowly at first, then
more quickly, keeping time with the flute. The serpents
danced, and the mind of every spectator involuntarily
compared their dance with the woman&rsquo;s that he had
seen a moment before. There was the same undulating
movement, the same evil charm, and every one
was conscious of an uncomfortable feeling at the
sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
Livette, surprised and strangely moved, thought that
she was dreaming. The spectacle before her was curiously,
deplorably in accord with the state of her heart.
She did not understand its hidden, intimate connection
with her own destiny, but she felt its baleful effects.
Zinzara&rsquo;s glance, from time to time, swept over the
girl&rsquo;s face, but did not rest upon it. On the subject of
her own influence, Zinzara knew what she knew.</p>

<p>Soft, soft as spun silk, the notes of the flute arose,
very soft and prolonged, like threads extending from
the instrument and winding about the necks of the
little snakes; and the little snakes followed the notes
of the flute, which drew them on and on. Zinzara
walked backward. The little snakes followed her as if
they were held fast by the notes of the flute as by silken
threads. The gipsy stopped, and the notes <em>grew shorter</em>,
so to speak, like the threads one winds about a bobbin.
Then the snakes approached the sorceress, and as Zinzara
stooped slowly over them, and put down her hands,
still holding the flute, upon which she did not cease to
play, the snakes twined themselves about her bare arms.
Thence one of them climbed up and wound about her
neck, letting his little head, with its wide open mouth
and quivering tongue, hang down upon her swelling
breast. And when she stood erect again, two others
were seen at her ankles, above the rings she wore on her
legs. Then she laid aside her flute and began to laugh.
Her laugh disclosed her regular, white teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if any one will give me his hand,
I will tell his fortune!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But no hand was put forward to meet hers because of
the little snakes.</p>

<p>Zinzara laughed aloud, and her laugh, in very truth,
recalled certain notes of her double flute.</p>

<p>At that moment, Livette started to walk away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, you!&rdquo; said the gipsy quickly,&mdash;&ldquo;you refused
to listen to me once, but to-day you must be very
anxious to find out where your lover is, my beauty!
Give me your hand without fear, if you are worthy to
become the wife of a brave horseman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Livette blushed vividly. Her two young friends
arrived just then and heard what was said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you do it!&rdquo; said one of them in an undertone, pulling
Livette&rsquo;s skirt from behind; but, Livette, annoyed by
the gipsy&rsquo;s expression, in which she fancied that she
could detect a touch of mockery, put out her hand, not
without a mental prayer for protection to the sainted
Marys. The gipsy took the proffered hand in her own.
The snakes put out their forked tongues. Livette was
somewhat pale.</p>

<p>They were both very small, the fortune-teller&rsquo;s hand
and the maiden&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Renaud looked on from above with all his eyes,
greatly surprised and a little disturbed in mind.</p>

<p>The gipsy held Livette&rsquo;s hand in her own a moment,
exulting to feel the palpitations of the bird she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
fascinating. She had hoped to intimidate Livette, and
the courage the girl displayed annoyed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your future husband isn&rsquo;t far away, my beauty,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;but he is not here on your account, never
fear! On whose, then? That is for you to guess!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Livette, already somewhat pale, became as white as
a ghost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That alone, I fancy, is of interest to you, my pretty
sweetheart! Then I&rsquo;ll say no more to you except this:
Beware; the serpent on my left wrist just whispered
something to me. Look well to your love!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shudder ran through the spectators like a ripple
over the surface of a swamp. One of the snakes was,
in fact, hissing gently.</p>

<p>The gipsy released Livette&rsquo;s hand; as the girl turned
to go away, she came face to face with Rampal. He
had been wandering about the village since early morning,
and had just joined the group, unseen by any one,
even by Renaud.</p>

<p>Livette recoiled instinctively and in such a marked
way that Rampal might well have taken it for an
affront. Unfortunately, having left the front row, she
was hemmed in by the crowd on all sides of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oho! young lady,&rdquo; said Rampal, &ldquo;so we don&rsquo;t
recognize our friends!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, good-day, Rampal,&rdquo; replied Livette,
repeating the salutation as the custom is in the province;
&ldquo;but let me pass! Make room for me, I say!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
&ldquo;<i>Sur le pont d&rsquo;Avignon</i>,&rdquo; sang the gipsy, with a
laugh, &ldquo;<i>tout le monde paye passage!</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Renaud, still behind his window, had at last recognized
Rampal. Fuming with rage, but naturally wary,
he considered whether he should rush down at once and
attack him or wait until Livette had gone.</p>

<p>Rampal did not always need a pretext to kiss a pretty
girl,&mdash;but here was one ready-made for him!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you hear, demoiselle?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You must
pay the tollman of your own accord, or else he will pay
himself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He threw both arms about the poor child&rsquo;s waist.
She bent back, holding her body and her head as far
away from him as possible, but the rascal, hot of breath,
holding her firmly and forcing her a little closer, kissed
her twice full upon the lips.</p>

<p>A fierce oath was uttered behind them in the air.
Everybody turned, and, looking up, discovered Renaud
shaking the old-fashioned window, which was reluctant
to be opened. Two more wrenches and the window
yielded, flew suddenly open with a great noise of breaking
glass, and Renaud, standing on the sill, leaped to
the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! the beggar! the beggar! where is the vile
cur?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Rampal had already leaped upon his horse that
was hitched near by to the bars of a low window, and
was off at a gallop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
He rode as if he were riding a race, half-standing in
his stirrups, his body bent forward, and plying incessantly
and very rapidly a thong that was made fast to
his wrist, and that drove his horse wild by the way it
whistled about his ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coward! coward!&rdquo; one of the young men present
could not refrain from shouting after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coward? oh! no!&rdquo; said Renaud&mdash;&ldquo;simply a thief!
for if he weren&rsquo;t riding a horse he never intends to
return, the fellow wouldn&rsquo;t run away&mdash;I know him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned to poor, frightened Livette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never fear, demoiselle,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;he shall not
carry our horse to paradise with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was it Renaud&rsquo;s purpose, in saying this, to make the
gipsy think that he was bent upon taking vengeance for
the theft of his horse rather than for the insult put upon
his fianc&eacute;e? Perhaps so; but the devil is so cunning
that Renaud himself had no idea that he was capable
of such craft.</p>

<p>As to the gipsy, she said to herself that Renaud, by
jumping out of the window, instead of coming quietly
down the stairs, had compromised his prospects of revenge
for the satisfaction of exhibiting his gipsy-like
agility to her. He did, in truth, jump like a wild cat,
and rebound as if he were equipped with elastic paws!
He was as agile as a true <i>zingaro</i>! He was as handsome
and bold as a highwayman! They are gipsies, to all
intents, these wandering guardians of mares and heifers!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
Renaud, who had disappeared long enough to buckle
his horse&rsquo;s girth, rode by in a few moments upon Prince;
the witnesses of the scene just enacted were still discussing
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catch him! catch him! eat him, King!&rdquo; cried
twenty young men&rsquo;s voices in chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the King and the Prince arrayed against him,
Rampal is a dead man,&rdquo; some one remarked, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>Renaud was already at a distance. He had not looked
at the gipsy, but he felt that her eyes were upon him,
and he felt now that they were following him from
afar; and the feeling caused a pleasurable thrill, of
which he was conscious, and for which he reproved
himself vaguely on Livette&rsquo;s account, but without seeking
to repress it. Yes, as he galloped along in his
wrath, he galloped in a particular way in order that
his wrath might show to good advantage, so that he
might appear a handsome and graceful horseman, as
he was in fact. He was conscious of every movement
that he made&mdash;he fancied that he could see himself,
and was desirous to make a good appearance, he,
the King!</p>

<p>The peacock, in the mating season, has more gorgeous
plumage, and makes the greatest possible display of it.
The nightingale and the redbreast have sweeter voices.
All alike take pleasure in so arraying themselves as to
give pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
&ldquo;Where are you going, Livette?&rdquo; her two friends
asked her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to see monsieur le cur&eacute;. I must have
a talk with him, poor me! for it was a great sin to listen
to that sorceress, you know!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14"></a>XIV<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">JOUSTING</span></h2>


<p>Both Renaud and Rampal had spears.</p>

<p>As he rode by the Neuf farm, half a league from
Saintes-Maries, Rampal, who owned nothing in the
world but his saddle, and had no spear, being at that
time simply a drover out of a job, had spied one leaning
against a fig-tree, and had appropriated it without dismounting,
had &ldquo;borrowed it without a word,&rdquo; thinking
that he should probably need it to defend himself.</p>

<p>Now he was galloping across the fields, leaning forward
on his horse&rsquo;s neck, with his thong in his boot
and the spear resting in the stirrup.</p>

<p>Renaud had mistaken the road in his hot pursuit.
Perhaps the gipsy was the cause of it, for, in spite of
himself, in order to remain within her range of vision,
Renaud had ridden straight toward the Vaccar&egrave;s, while
Rampal had just taken the road to Arles, avoiding stratagem
in order to mislead his pursuer more effectually,
for he said to himself that Renaud would surely argue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
that he had made for the middle of the island to take
refuge in some deserted <i>jass</i>.</p>

<p>Renaud divined Rampal&rsquo;s plan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will keep to the road,&rdquo; he suddenly thought,
and feeling certain that he was right, he turned to the
left and rode due west. Rampal, having the start of him
by a full league, drew rein in the vicinity of Grandes-Cabanes,
and having planted his spear-head in the
ground, rested both hands upon it, then placed his feet,
one after the other, on the hind-quarters of his horse,
and stood there for some moments, scanning the plain
behind him. Between two clumps of tamarisks he
caught a glimpse of a horseman, like a flash of light, or
like a rabbit scuttling between two wild thyme bushes&mdash;Renaud,
beyond question! Rampal saw that Renaud,
if it were he, was about to take to the road, and he
himself thereupon left it and rode in the opposite direction
on a line parallel to that his enemy was following
in the distance. When Renaud reached the road and
turned into it, Rampal had the Vaccar&egrave;s in front of
him, and there he turned to the left and followed the
shore. His plan was to cross the main stream of
the Rh&ocirc;ne, and reach the Conscript&rsquo;s Hut, in the
middle of the <i>gargate</i>, the spot where he was confident
of finding safe shelter in times of serious danger. Unluckily
for him, he had been seen&mdash;when he was standing
on his horse watching his man&mdash;by a fisherman who was
crouching on the edge of the canal, fishing for eels with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
a reed and a short line, at the end of which was a bunch
of worms, strung and twisted together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Rampal, friend?&rdquo; said Renaud, stopping
his horse short as soon as he saw the fisherman, who
was just about changing his place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! King, are you the man who is looking for
him?&rdquo; said the fisherman, an old man. &ldquo;If he has
kept to the road he took to get away from you,&mdash;for I
saw he was watching some one behind him,&mdash;he ought
to be on the shore of the Vaccar&egrave;s by this time, and
from there, if he doesn&rsquo;t go back to Saintes-Maries, he
will surely go up toward Notre-Dame-d&rsquo;Amour. You
have a good horse, and you can catch him between the
Vaccar&egrave;s and the Grand&rsquo; Mar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Renaud darted away as if he had wings.</p>

<p>After an hour and a half of furious riding,&mdash;he was
wise enough, however, to change his gait several times,-he
drew rein, a little discouraged; then, after a brief
halt and a draught of brandy from the flask that never
left his holsters, he resumed his headlong race&mdash;but not
until he had thoughtfully allowed his horse to drink a
swallow of water from the canal.</p>

<p>When he was between the Grand&rsquo; Mar swamp and the
Vaccar&egrave;s, he found his own drove taking their midday
rest there, under the guidance of Bernard, his young
assistant.</p>

<p>Horses and bulls were lying motionless on the shore
of the Vaccar&egrave;s, in the twofold glare from sky and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
water, for it was well-nigh noon, and the light was
dazzling.</p>

<p>Bernard was resting likewise, lying on his back with
his head on the saddle, not far from his horse, which
was fettered near by, learning to amble.</p>

<p>In front of Renaud lay the pearl-gray Vaccar&egrave;s,
gleaming like a huge table of polished steel, in the
centre of which a veritable white islet of sea-mews were
sleeping, motionless as statues.</p>

<p>Behind him stretched an ashen-gray plain, which
could be seen only in spots&mdash;where the salt emerged in
efflorescent crystals&mdash;glistening through a vast violet net-work
of flowering <i>saladelles</i>; for the <i>saladelles</i> spread
out in broad, graceful tufts, with many ramifications,
but without foliage, dotted with a multitude of lilac
blossoms, between which the ground can be seen. And
farther away the fields of glasswort began, with their
plump, juicy leaves; they are a beautiful rich green
when they are young, but the salt air soon turns them
blood-red, so that the oldest and those nearest the sea
are the darkest.</p>

<p>Here and there the stunted tamarisk, with its gnarled
trunk, dotted the plain, its sparse foliage tinged with
pink by the blossoms hanging in tiny clusters, which,
tiny though they be, are a heavy burden for its flexible
branches.</p>

<p>And in the dry, seamy bottoms were great patches of
<i>siagnes</i>, <i>triangles</i>, <i>apa&iuml;uns</i> of every kind, <i>can&eacute;ous</i> or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
dwarf reeds used in making roofs and matting, thorn-broom
and all sorts of aquatic plants, bright green, and
straight as fields of grain; their angular battalions,
harvested in summer, go down before the scythe in
broad half-circles. Above these patches of verdure,
which bend and rustle with the faintest breath of air,
hovered dragon-flies with enormous heads,&mdash;swallow-like
insects, voracious devourers of gnats. They flew
about with the swallows over the waters where the mosquito
is born, making a metallic sound among the reeds
when their wings of transparent, black-veined mica
came in contact with them.</p>

<p>Renaud gazed at these familiar things and forgot himself
in them. For a second he fancied that he was
watching his drove there, and that he had nothing else
to do but remain with his beasts, absorbed, as they
were, in calm, unreasoning contemplation of the desert
that surrounded him. He ceased to love, to hate, to
desire, and to pursue.</p>

<p>The shadow of wings passed him by. He raised his
eyes and saw, above his head, two red flamingoes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They built their nest here this year,&rdquo; he thought.</p>

<p>But Prince, the good horse, had recognized his favorite
mares, and, stretching out his neck, opening his
nostrils wide to inhale the fresh breeze of the swamp
and the plain, raising his lips and displaying his teeth,
he gave a neigh that made all the mares spring to their
feet at a single bound, the bulls raise their heads, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
Bernard himself jump up from the ground, spear in
hand.</p>

<p>Renaud, pressing his knees together and pulling his
horse back, held him in hand, although he trembled
under him and pranced up and down in the soft
sand.</p>

<p>At the same time, a sudden gust of the <i>mistral</i> swept
across the plain and broke the mirror-like surface of the
Vaccar&egrave;s into little waves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it is Rampal you are looking for,&rdquo; said Bernard,
&ldquo;he isn&rsquo;t far away, you may be sure. When he saw me
here, all of a sudden&mdash;just a moment ago&mdash;he rode off
that way. And as he went out of my sight very soon, I
believe he has gone into some cabin. You had better
look around the M&eacute;jeane tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Renaud was off again.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes fell upon a low cabin with its rush-covered
roof, shaped like a pyramid, or like a stack of
straw, and surmounted, as they all are, by its wooden
cross, bending back as if the <i>mistral</i> were gradually
blowing it over.</p>

<p>The thought came to him: &ldquo;Rampal is there! His
horse must be tired. He retraced his steps a short
distance without Bernard&rsquo;s seeing him, and went into
hiding there&mdash;hoping that I should be thrown off the
scent and would ride by. Yes, he is surely there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Renaud turned about, and rode straight toward the
cabin, keeping a sharp lookout; whereupon Rampal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
who was really hidden there, watching his pursuer
through the holes in the wall, rushed out, frightening
an owl that flew away in dismay, and leaped upon his
horse which was browsing in hobbles near by, but out
of sight, at the bottom of a ditch.</p>

<p>The <i>mistral</i>, which comes like a cannon-ball when it
makes up its mind to blow at that time of day, suddenly
began to roar. Renaud had put his head down to meet
the squall, so that he did not perceive this man&oelig;uvre
of the enemy.</p>

<p>So it was that Rampal seemed suddenly to come up
out of the ground, not twenty feet from Renaud, who
was not taken by surprise, however, but rushed at him,
brandishing his spear, for all the world like one of the
knights of the time of Saint Louis, of whom our legends
tell. (Aigues-Mortes was then in its prime.)</p>

<p>But Camargue is, as every one knows, the mother of
the <i>mistral</i>&mdash;the vast sunny plain, with Crau, which,
after sending the air up by dint of overheating it, is
compelled to summon other air in order to breathe at
all. And thereupon, down the Rh&ocirc;ne valley, at the
summons of the desert, comes a torrent of fresh air,
which is the companion of the river, and is called the
<i>mistral</i>. It roared through Renaud&rsquo;s open vest as in
the belly of a sail, and, taking Prince sidewise, kept
him back a little. It was no easy matter to leap the
ditch. That gave the advantage to Rampal, who was
now trotting freely along, face to the wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
The ditch was now between the two men, and Rampal&rsquo;s
only purpose in trotting along the edge of it was
to limber up his horse&rsquo;s legs. Renaud, abandoning the
idea of crossing the ditch for the moment, decided to
follow along on his side. The two horsemen rode thus
for a few moments. Rampal had prudently protected
his face from the <i>mistral</i> with a red silk handkerchief,
the ends of which flapped about his neck.</p>

<p>Suddenly, taking advantage of a spot where the banks
came somewhat nearer together, Renaud lifted his horse
and landed on the other side of the ditch at the very
instant that Rampal, having executed the same man&oelig;uvre
in the opposite direction, landed on the side Renaud
had left.</p>

<p>Renaud did not find a favorable spot for crossing at
once, and Rampal gained upon him.</p>

<p>Having at last crossed the obstacle once more, Renaud
pursued Rampal at full speed, and so rapidly that, when
Rampal turned to judge the distance between them, he
saw Renaud hardly fifty paces behind him.</p>

<p>He had just time to turn about, and waited for his foe,
with lance in rest, leaning forward in his saddle, his feet
planted firmly in the broad stirrups.</p>

<p>Renaud, unluckily, was charging against the <i>mistral</i>.
A sort of hail, consisting of sand and of the little snails
that cling in myriads to the leaves of the <i>enganes</i>, beat
into his face and angered him.</p>

<p>Five hundred feet away, Bernard was looking on&mdash;not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
saying a word, for fear of Rampal, but praying fervently
for Renaud, and he fancied that he was watching
two champions standing on the long ladders in the prows
of the jousting boats, with their lances held firmly under
their right arms. Rampal&rsquo;s spear, being suddenly lowered
too far by a false step of his horse, pricked the
heel of Renaud&rsquo;s boot and grazed Prince&rsquo;s flank, whereupon
he jumped violently aside, as if he were avoiding
the horns of a heifer.</p>

<p>Renaud&rsquo;s spear tore the sleeve of his enemy&rsquo;s blue
shirt and carried away the piece.</p>

<p>The horsemen met and passed each other.</p>

<p>Rampal was the first to turn, and rode after Renaud,
ready to strike him from behind, while he was struggling
to stop Prince, who had acquired too much momentum;
and Prince, hearing the other horse&rsquo;s hurried step, and
feeling his hot breath behind him, furious at being held
back, fearing that he would be overtaken, turned about
so quickly and unexpectedly in his wrath, that Rampal
took fright and turned again, but involuntarily.</p>

<p>Renaud, finding that his pursuer had once more
become a fugitive, gave Prince a free rein.</p>

<p>The stallion was off like the wind.</p>

<p>The horsemen sped along, pushed on by the gusts,
the wind being now behind them.</p>

<p>The mares and heifers, the whole drove, in fact, stood
with their heads in the air, staring eyes, and nostrils
distended, watching the two men come down toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
them, bending over their horses&rsquo; necks, reins flying, as
if pursued by the tempest along the shores of the pond,
whose waters were dancing and rippling in the wind.</p>

<p>Here and there the little tamarisks, bent almost double,
seemed likewise to be fleeing from the storm. There
were no more gnats or dragon-flies in the air. Above
the Vaccar&egrave;s the spray was flying. The <i>mistral</i> swept
everything clean.</p>

<p>Two minutes later, powerless to control their enervated
beasts, excited as they were by the struggle and
the wind, the two adversaries rode at full speed through
the drove.</p>

<p>Thereupon, inflamed by the sight of their two stallions
racing madly by, alarmed at the sight of the waving
spears, intoxicated by the wild wind that found a way
into their bodies through their fiery nostrils, the mares
neighed and reared and started off together on the
gallop. The heifers followed. Hundreds of hoofs and
cloven feet beat the ground with a noise like the roaring
of a tempest, and the whole drove, lashed by the <i>mistral</i>,
which howled behind them, biting them and urging
them forward, rolled across the plain like a second
Rh&ocirc;ne. And while Bernard was saddling his horse in
hot haste to overtake them, the two enemies galloped
in the midst of the hurricane as if borne on by the
stamping of eighty beasts, whose hoofs raised clouds of
sand and showers of spray and mud in the wind that
travelled faster than they!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
At the head of this whirlwind, and still in the midst
of it, Renaud succeeded in overtaking Rampal. When
he was near enough to touch him, he selected the precise
moment when his horse was raising his left hind
foot, to strike him on the right hind-quarter. The right
leg, just as it was about to strike the ground, bent double
under the blow of a spear directed by a man riding at
a gallop, and Rampal and his horse rolled over among
the countless galloping hoofs that shook the earth.</p>

<p>Bulls and horses leaped over the two bodies lying
there, man and beast, and when the drove, tired and
subdued, came to a stop half a league farther on,
Renaud, still riding Prince, was holding by the bridle
his recaptured horse, bleeding only in the flank and at
the nose.</p>

<p>Standing beside him, with rage in his heart, stained
with mud and dust, his face bleeding and the skin torn
from the palms of the hands, Rampal, red as fire, was
occupied in rearranging his breeches and fastening his
belt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait till next time, Renaud! After this you would
expect a man to seek revenge, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But his shrill voice was drowned in the howling of the
<i>mistral</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me back my saddle!&rdquo; he shouted in a louder
tone.</p>

<p>The drover&rsquo;s saddle is his whole fortune. He cherishes
it, loves it, takes pride in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
&ldquo;Your saddle?&rdquo; rejoined Renaud suspiciously. &ldquo;Come
with me and get it! Bernard will give it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and without another word
rode after the drove, leading back to it the emaciated
horse which Rampal had sadly misused.</p>

<p>He was extremely glad that Blanchet had had no
part in this duel. He recognized Blanchet from afar
in among the mares, but sleeker and better cared for
than the others. A true lady&rsquo;s horse, staunch as he
was!&mdash;And now he would be able to return him to his
mistress, as he had his former horse, in addition to
Prince. And his nostrils dilated with the pride of
victory. He inhaled long draughts of the bracing salt
air.</p>

<p>He was thinking of two women&mdash;yes, of two, not one
only!&mdash;who would say of him when they heard what
had taken place: &ldquo;That is a man!&rdquo; And Renaud&rsquo;s
noble horse shared his master&rsquo;s pride, as he capered
about, in the liberty accorded him to choose his own
pace, with the proud bearing of a stallion that had won
the race in the sight of his whole drove.</p>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15"></a>XV<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">MONSIEUR LE CUR&Eacute;&rsquo;S ARCH&AElig;OLOGY</span></h2>


<p>The cur&eacute; of Saintes-Maries was a man of about sixty,
well preserved, very tall and stout, with bright eyes
whose light he quenched with spectacles, and energetic
gestures which he purposely restrained.</p>

<p>The parsonage was near the church, the doorway
shaded by a number of elms. The house, in accordance
with the prevailing custom of the province, was
whitewashed once a year, outside and in, like the houses
of the Arabs.</p>

<p>The houses in Saintes-Maries are low. The streets
are narrow, and wind about to escape the sun. The
shadows under the awnings of the little shops have a
bluish cast. In front of the doors, which open on the
street, hang transparent curtains of common linen, in
some cases of very fine net-work, to stop the flies and
admit the light after it has passed through the sieve, so
to speak. And, behind them, the maidens of Saintes-Maries
are confined like birdlings in a cage, or like very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
dangerous little wild beasts. Are not all maidens to be
looked upon with more or less suspicion?</p>

<p>The maidens of Saintes-Maries wear the Arles head-dress
and the neckerchief, with fold upon fold held in
place by hundreds of pins, by as many pins as a rose-bush
has thorns; and where the thick folds of the handkerchief
open, in the depths of the <i>chapelle</i>, you can
see the little golden cross gleaming upon the firm young
flesh rising and falling with the maidenly sigh. The
apron worn over the ample skirt seems like a skirt itself,
it is so broad and full, and slender feet peep out from beneath
it, as agile as the Camargue partridge&rsquo;s red claws,
that love to scamper swiftly over the fields to escape
the hunter, knowing that Camargue is broad and space
is plentiful.</p>

<p>Many are the pale faces at Saintes, for, whatever they
may say, the marshes still breed fever, and this country,
to which people come to be miraculously cured, is,
generally speaking, a country of disease; but pallor
goes well with the wavy black hair, worn in broad puffs
on the temples and falling upon the neck in two heavy
masses which are turned up to meet the <i>chignon</i>. To
help them to forget what is depressing in their lives, they
resort, here as elsewhere, to coquetry&mdash;and the rest!&mdash;And
then they are accustomed to the fever, which gives
birth to dreams and visions; they tame it, as it were; it
is not cruel to the people it knows, and does not lead
them to the cemetery until they are old and gray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
The cemetery is a few steps from the village, a few
steps from the sea. It lies at the foot of the sand-dunes,
surrounded by a low wall. The dead and gone
villagers of Saintes-Maries lie sleeping there between
the sea and the desert of Camargue: many fishermen
who lived in their flat-bottomed boats; many herdsmen
who lived on horseback in the plain.</p>

<p>All of them alike find there, in death, the things
amid which their lives have been passed: the salt sand,
filled with tiny shells, the <i>enganes</i> that grow in spite of
everything, reddened by the salt-laden winds, and heavy
with soda,&mdash;and the thin shadow of the pink-plumed
tamarisk. There they hear the neighing of the wild
mares, the shouts of the herdsmen contending on the
race-course on f&ecirc;te-days, or stirring up the black bulls
in the arena under the walls of the church. They hear
the sails flapping, and the <i>han</i> of the bare-legged fishermen
pushing their flat-bottomed boats or barges into
the water; and night and day, the pounding of the sea
in its efforts to push back the island of Camargue, while
the Rh&ocirc;ne, on the other hand, is constantly pushing it
into the sea, and adding to its bulk with mud and stones
brought down from its head-waters. The sea smites the
island as if it would have none of it, but all in vain,&mdash;it,
too, can but augment its size with the sand it casts up.</p>

<p>And the sand from the sea makes a broad hem of
dunes along the shores of Camargue.</p>

<p>No one can fail to see that the dunes, those shifting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
tomb-like hills of sand, must have served as models for
the massive pyramids, the tombs of kings, in the Egyptian
desert.</p>

<p>At the feet of the little pyramids of sand sleep the
dead of Camargue.</p>

<p>But whither has the thought of death led us? Why
do we tarry here, while Livette is timidly lifting the
knocker at monsieur le cur&eacute;&rsquo;s door?</p>

<p>The blow echoed within the house, in the empty hall.
Livette was much perturbed. What was she to say?
Where should she begin? The beginning is always the
most difficult part. She would like to run away now,
but it is too late. She hears steps inside. Marion, the
old servant, opens the door.</p>

<p>Marion has a practised eye. When any one knocks
at Monsieur le cur&eacute;&rsquo;s door, she knows, simply by examining
his face, what he wants, and frames her answers
accordingly, on her own responsibility; for Monsieur
le cur&eacute; is subject to rheumatism: he suffers from fever,
too, and Marion nurses Monsieur le cur&eacute;! If he listened
to Marion, he would nurse himself so carefully that all
the sick people would have to die unshriven, without
extreme unction, for Marion would always have a good
reason to give to prevent him from going out by day or
night, when the <i>mistral</i> was blowing or the wind was
from the east, summer or winter, rain or shine.</p>

<p>But Monsieur le cur&eacute; would smile and do just what he
chose. He was a good priest. He never failed in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
duty. He loved his parishioners. He assisted them on
all occasions with his purse and his advice. He was
beloved by them all.</p>

<p>He loved his parishioners, his commune, and his curious
church, which was once a fortress; he was familiar
with the shape of its every stone. He loved it both as
priest and as archaeologist, for Monsieur le cur&eacute; is a
scholar, and his church is, in very truth, one of the
most interesting monuments in France, with its abnormally
thick, high, and threatening walls, crowned with
jutting galleries and surmounted by crenelated battlements,
with an unobstructed view of sea and land in all
directions, and overlooked by four turrets, and a tower
in the centre,&mdash;the highest of all,&mdash;from whose belfry
the alarum bell, in the old days, often aroused the
country-side, repeating in its shrillest tones: &ldquo;Here
come the heathens, good people of Saintes-Maries!
Attention! Come and shut yourselves up here! Make
ready your arrows and the boiling oil and pitch!&rdquo;&mdash;Or
else: &ldquo;Hasten to the shore, good people of Saintes-Maries!
A French vessel is sinking!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And to this day it seems still to say, to all, far and
near: &ldquo;I see you! I see you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>One could go on forever describing the church of
Saintes-Maries, and relating anecdotes concerning it.</p>

<p>Behind the battlements at the top, and enclosing the
roof of flat stones, runs a narrow pathway, where the
archers and patrols in the old days used to make their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
rounds, surrounded by countless sea-swallows. Along
the ridge-pole of the roof, of overlapping broad flat
stones, between which thick tufts of <i>nasques</i> are growing,
rises a high carved comb, in ogive-like curves, surmounted
by fleurs-de-lis.</p>

<p>All this is beautiful and grand, but there is a little
thing of which the villagers are as proud as of the bell-tower
and the turrets, and that is a marble tablet, about
five courses in length by three in height, on which two
lions are represented. One is protecting its whelp; the
other seems to be protecting a little child, as if it were
its own offspring. It seems that this tablet was carved
by a Greek workman long, long ago.</p>

<p>The marble is set into the southern wall of the church,
beside the small door.</p>

<p>You enter. The ogive arch of the nave compels you
to raise your eyes to a great height. And as you enter
by the main door, your attention is attracted by a
romanesque arch, directly in front of you, at the far
end of the church, at least five metres below the ogive
arch of the nave; in the centre of this arch are the
blessed reliquaries, resting upon the sill of an opening
like a window, flanked by two columns. From that
position they are lowered once in every year at the ends
of two ropes.</p>

<p>The choir is some few feet higher than the flagging
of the church. It is reached by two symmetrical staircases,
between which is the grated door leading down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
into Sara&rsquo;s crypt. That door you can see, directly in
front of you, at the end of the passage through the
centre of the church, between the rows of chairs. One
would say that it was the air-hole of a dungeon.</p>

<p>Down below, in the damp crypt, with its low arched
roof and naked walls,&mdash;a veritable dungeon,&mdash;upon a
mutilated marble altar, is the little glass shrine containing
the relics of Saint Sara, the patron saint of the
gipsies. There, amid the smoke of their candles, in an
atmosphere made foul by human exhalations, you can
see them once a year, huddled together in a dense
crowd, mumbling their questionable prayers.</p>

<p>In the days of the Saracen invasions this crypt served
as a storehouse for supplies, when all the inhabitants of
the little village were forced to take refuge in the fortress-church.</p>

<p>Aigues-Mortes has her walls and her Constance Tower,
massive as Babel; N&icirc;mes has her Arena and her Fountain&mdash;and
the Pont du Gard, superb in its beauty, is also
hers; Avignon her bridges, her ramparts, and her clocks
with figures of armed men to strike the hours; Tarascon
her Ch&acirc;teau, mirrored in the Rh&ocirc;ne; Baux the fantastic
ruins of her houses, hollowed, like the cells of a bee-hive,
out of the solid rock of the hill-side; Montmajour has
her tombs of little children, also dug, side by side, in
the solid rock, and to-day filled with earth and flowers,
like the troughs at which doves drink; Orange has her
theatre and her triumphal arch; Arles has her theatre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
with the two pillars still upright in the centre; she has
Saint-Trophime, too, with its sculptured fa&ccedil;ade and its
<i>All&eacute;e des Alyscamps</i>, bordered with Christian sarcophagi
and lofty poplars. But Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer has her
church, which Monsieur le cur&eacute; would not give for all
the treasures of the other towns!</p>

<p>Marion saw plainly that Livette was depressed;
Marion was touched when Livette said: &ldquo;I must see
Monsieur le cur&eacute;,&rdquo; and as her master would not be
seriously discommoded, there being no occasion for him
to leave the house, Marion ushered Livette into the
parlor.</p>

<p>It was a whitewashed room, but the cur&eacute; had transformed
it into a veritable museum, and the walls were
completely hidden behind wooden cabinets, made by
himself, and all filled with his collections.</p>

<p>There were pieces of antique pottery and of rainbow-hued
antique glass. There were old medals.</p>

<p>One of the latter attracted Livette&rsquo;s attention. It
represented a bull in the act of falling; one of his fore-legs
had given way. A man, his conqueror, had seized
him by the horns. That Grecian medal was struck
centuries upon centuries ago. A label explained it to
Livette, who thought at first that it was Renaud. Life
is all repetition.</p>

<p>There were collections of plants and boxes filled with
shells, and also many stuffed birds, all the varieties found
in Camargue. For more than thirty years, fishermen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
and hunters had presented Monsieur le cur&eacute; with curious
objects and animals. Here was an otter from the Rh&ocirc;ne,
there a beaver, with his trowel-shaped tail and hooked
teeth. It is a question of serious importance whether
the beavers do not injure the dikes of the Rh&ocirc;ne. The
important point, you see, is that the water from the
swamps should empty into the river or the sea through
the canals, which run in all directions. Therefore, the
dikes must hold firm and not let the Rh&ocirc;ne overflow
the swamps. And the beavers, they say, destroy the
dikes. They gnaw into them when the great freshets
come, to avoid the drift, and take refuge inside; and
when the water comes in after them, they make a vertical
hole through which to escape, and there is your
dike, undermined, eaten into by the water! That is a
bad state of affairs.</p>

<p>Livette raised her eyes. A reptile, with his mouth
open, was hanging from the ceiling; he was very fat,
and well he might be! he was a little crocodile, the last
one killed in Camargue, a very long while ago!</p>

<p>In every nook left free by the natural curiosities some
pious image was to be seen. Here the two Maries in
their boat. There the Holy Women wrapping the Christ
in his shroud. In another place, Magdalen at La Baume,
kneeling in front of the death&rsquo;s-head. But Livette saw
no image of Saint Sara.</p>

<p>Livette sat down and waited. Monsieur le cur&eacute; did
not come. The fact was, that Monsieur le cur&eacute;, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
had already written two monographs, one entitled <i>La
Cure de Boismaux</i>, and the other <i>La Villa de la Mar</i>,
was at that moment at work upon a third: <i>Concordance
of the Legends of the Blessed Maries</i>, with this
sub-title: <i>Concerning the strange and regrettable confusion
that seems to exist between Saint Sara and Marie the
Egyptian.</i></p>

<p><i>La Cure de Boismaux</i> also had a sub-title: <i>Monograph
concerning the domains of the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon in
Camargue.</i> Monsieur le cur&eacute; recalled the fact that the
domains of the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon formerly constituted
a separate commune. That commune naturally had a
cur&eacute;, and in those days the proprietor of the Ch&acirc;teau
d&rsquo;Avignon was General Miollis, brother of the Bishop
of Digne mentioned by Monsieur Victor Hugo in <i>Les
Mis&eacute;rables</i> under the name of Myriel.</p>

<p>In a special chapter, Monsieur le cur&eacute; sought, to no
purpose, to find a reason, telluric or otherwise, for the
fact that the estates of the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon are particularly
subject to invasion by locusts, which sometimes
have to be fought in Camargue, as in Africa, by regiments.</p>

<p>As to the <i>Concordance</i>, that was a very important and
very necessary work. It was based, in great measure,
upon the authority of the <i>Black Book</i>. That Latin
work, preserved in the archives of Saintes-Maries, was
written, in 1521, by Vincent Philippon, who signed himself:
2000 Philippon!<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> (Jesus himself did not disdain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
the pun.) There is a French translation of the <i>Black
Book</i>. It was published in 1682, and begins thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Au nom de Dieu mon &oelig;uvre comanc&eacute;e<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Par J&eacute;sus-Christ soit toujours advanc&eacute;e.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Le Saint-Esprit conduise sagement<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ma main, ma plume, et mon entendement.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here follows the true version of the story of the patron
saints of Notre-Dame-de-la-Mer.</p>

<p>Marie Jacob&eacute;, mother of Saint James the Less, Marie
Salom&eacute;, mother of Saint James the Greater and of Saint
John the Evangelist, came not alone to the shores of
Camargue. The boat without sail or oars contained also
their servants Marcella and Sara, Lazarus and all his
family, and several of the Christ&rsquo;s disciples.</p>

<p>Monsieur le cur&eacute; would prove, with documents to
sustain him, that Mary Magdalen was not in the boat.
She came to Provence by some other means, no one
can say by what miracle.</p>

<p>With the exception of the two Maries and Sara, all
the passengers upon the miraculous craft dispersed in
different directions, preaching and making converts.</p>

<p>The holy women did not leave Camargue, the island
in the Rh&ocirc;ne, divided at that time into a great number
of small islands by the ponds&mdash;a veritable archipelago,
called <i>Sticados</i> and inhabited by heathens. In those
days, all these small islands, formed by the swamps,
were covered with forests and filled with wild beasts.
And this delta of the Rh&ocirc;ne was infested with crocodiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
Now, a long, long time after the death of the holy
women, a hunter, followed by his dogs, was passing over
the spot where they lay buried in unknown graves; he
fell in with a hermit there, beside a spring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;I had a revelation
in a dream last night. In the sand beside this spring
repose the bodies of three sainted women!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hunter was a Comte de Provence. His palace
was at Arles, and the cur&eacute; had every reason to believe
that he was Guillaume I., son of Boson I., famous for his
liberality to the church.</p>

<p>It was in 981. This Guillaume had overcome the
Saracens, and Conrad I., King of Bourgogne, his suzerain,
loved and respected him.</p>

<p>The prince, having listened to the hermit&rsquo;s tale, rode
away musing deeply; not long after, he returned and
caused a church in the form of a citadel to be built at
that point of the coast, in the very centre of a spacious
enclosure surrounded by moats.</p>

<p>Then he made known throughout Provence that
special privileges would be accorded to all those who
should build houses between the church and the moat.</p>

<p>Thus was founded the Villa-de-la-Mar&mdash;which is in
fact a town (<i>ville</i>), although it is too often spoken of as
a village, under its other name of Saintes-Maries.</p>

<p>The Comtes de Provence have always granted special
privileges to the town.</p>

<p>Under Queen Jeanne, a guard was stationed all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
time at the top of the church-tower to watch the ships
and make signals. Sentinels were obliged to call to
one another and answer every hour during the night.
The people of Saintes-Maries were also exempted by the
queen from payment of tolls and the tax upon salt.</p>

<p>Monsieur le cur&eacute; explains all these things in his book,
which is very interesting. He also describes therein,
&ldquo;as in duty bound,&rdquo; the discovery of the sacred bones.
In 1448, King Ren&eacute;, being then at Aix, his capital,
heard a preacher declare that Saintes Marie-Jacob&eacute; and
Salom&eacute; were certainly buried beneath the church of
Villa-de-la-Mar.</p>

<p>Ren&eacute; at once consulted his confessor, P&egrave;re Adh&eacute;mar,
and sent a messenger to the Pope, asking that he be
authorized to make search underground in the church.
The authorization was given in the month of June in the
same year. The Archbishop of Aix, Robert Damiani,
presided at the search.</p>

<p>They found the spring; near the spring was an earthen
altar; at the foot of the altar a marble tablet with this
inscription, upon which the good cur&eacute; descants at great
length:</p>

<p class="center">D. <span class="space">&nbsp;</span> M.<br />
IOV. M. L. CORN. BALBUS<br />
P. ANATILIORUM<br />
AD RHODANI<br />
OSTIA SACR. ARAM<br />
V. S. L. M.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
Lastly, they found the bones of the saints, perfectly
recognizable, and, in addition, a head sealed up in a
leaden box, which, according to the cur&eacute;, was the head
of Saint James the Less, brought from Jerusalem by
Marie-Jacob&eacute;, his mother.</p>

<p>The bones, having been devoutly taken from their
resting-place, were with great ceremony bestowed in
shrines of cypress wood. The king was present with
his court. The papal legate was also there, and an
archbishop, ten or twelve bishops, a great number of
ecclesiastical dignitaries, professors, and learned doctors.
The chancellor of the University of Avignon, too,
and&mdash;so the reports of the proceedings set forth&mdash;three
prothonotaries of the Holy See and three notaries
public.</p>

<p>And so nothing is more firmly established than the
authenticity of the relics of the saints.</p>

<p>But various apocryphal legends had appeared to throw
doubt upon the truth, and Monsieur le cur&eacute; was at work
upon the following passage while Livette, with increasing
uneasiness, was awaiting him in the parlor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Among the popular fallacies,&rdquo; wrote the cur&eacute;,
&ldquo;which destroy pure tradition, we must stigmatize as
one of the most deplorable, I may say one of the most
pernicious, that one which insists that among the passengers
of the miraculous craft was a third Saint Marie,
surnamed the Egyptian. It is downright heresy! How
could it have taken root, and how far does it extend?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
Monsieur le cur&eacute; proposed to retouch that last phrase
forthwith, and for a very good reason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without doubt,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;the Egyptians,
or Bohemians, or gipsies, by manifesting, from remote
times, particular veneration for Saint Sara, who was,
according to their ideas, an Egyptian and the wife of
Pontius Pilate, have contributed to the formation of an
absurd legend, but this one has its source, or its root,
in something different; there is an episode of a boat
in the life of the Egyptian, which assists the error by
causing confusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monsieur le cur&eacute; proposed to return to that paragraph
also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Born in the outskirts of Alexandria, Marie the Egyptian
left her family to lead the life of shame she had
chosen, in the great city. Coming to a river, she desired
to cross it in a boat, and having not the wherewithal for
her passage, she paid the boatman in an impure manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Later, she undertook a journey to Jerusalem with
a great number of pilgrims, and on that occasion again
she paid the expenses of her journey in diabolical fashion,
especially if we remember that those whom she
enticed into evil ways were devout pilgrims! And so,
when she presented herself at the door of the temple,
an invisible and invincible force held her back. She
could not gain admission there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monsieur le cur&eacute; was better satisfied with that, and
took a pinch of snuff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
&ldquo;She thereupon withdrew to the desert, where she
lived forty-seven years. Her image appeared one day
to the monk Sosimus at Jerusalem. She appeared before
him naked and begged him to come and confess her.
He obeyed, and went into the desert. He found her,
naked, indeed, but very old. And Sosimus was convinced
of her saintliness because she had the power of
walking on the water. He listened to her confession.
She died in the odor of sanctity, as decrepit and horrible
to look upon as she had been fair and pleasant to
the sight. A lion dug a grave for her with his claws
in the sand of the desert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Egyptian&rsquo;s long penance had redeemed her
life, therefore, and under Louis IX. the Parisians dedicated
a church to her, which bore the name of Sainte-Marie-l&rsquo;&Eacute;gyptienne,&mdash;corrupted
at a later period to
<i>La Gypecienne</i> and then to <i>La Jussienne</i>. This church
was on Rue Montmartre, at the corner of Rue de la
Jussienne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The church contained a stained window representing
the saint and the boatman, with this inscription:
<i>How the saint offered her body to the boatman to pay
her passage.</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;We must not, then, in any case, confound Saint
Sara, a contemporary of the Christ, with Marie the
Egyptian, who lived in the fifth century,&mdash;a fact that
cuts short all controversy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very fortunate,&rdquo; continued Monsieur le cur&eacute;,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
well pleased with his somewhat tardy conclusion, &ldquo;that
such a sinner was not among those on board the boat of
our Maries-de-la-Mer, for in that boat, as we have said
above, there were several of the Christ&rsquo;s disciples.
<i>Spiritus quidem promptus est; caro autem infirma.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Monsieur le cur&eacute; took snuff, he removed and replaced
his spectacles. Monsieur le cur&eacute; forgot himself. He
went over all the early pages of his treatise, he struck
out and interlined; he struggled with rebellious words.
From time to time, he adjusted his spectacles more
firmly, and opened and consulted an ancient book of
great size. He was very busy, very deeply absorbed in
his favorite employment. He forgot that somebody
was waiting for him, and poor Livette, all alone in the
parlor, with the dead birds and the shells, was sadly
disturbed in mind. The melancholy that possessed her
was not dissipated&mdash;far from it!&mdash;by the place in which
she found herself.</p>

<p>All the dead birds, most of which she recognized as
birds of passage, reminded her of the weariness of
winter, the season when the wave-washed island is immersed
in fog.</p>

<p>There were screech-owls, the pale-yellow owls that
live in church-steeples and at night drink the oil in the
church-lamps; vultures that come down from the Alps
and Pyrenees in times of excessive cold; the ash-colored
vulture that lives at Sainte-Baume. There are little
tomtits, called <i>serruriers</i> (locksmiths), which are found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
only on the banks of the Rh&ocirc;ne, and <i>pendulines</i>, so
called because they hang their nests like little pendulums
from the flexible branches swaying to and fro above the
water; and <i>stocking-makers</i>, whose nests resemble the
tissue of a knitted stocking; and the <i>alcyon</i>, that is to
say, the <i>bleuret</i> or kingfisher; and the <i>siren</i>, of the brilliant
diversified plumage, called also <i>honey-eater</i>, which
flies north in the month of May, and spends its winters
by preference in Camargue. There was a stork, that
probably considered Camargue, between the dikes of
the Rh&ocirc;ne, a little like Holland. There, too, was the
heron with its frill of delicate feathers, falling like a
long fringe over its throat. Livette knew it only by
the name of <i>galejon</i>, bestowed upon it in that neighborhood
because the herons&rsquo; favorite place of assemblage
was the pond of Galejon. There was one that bore on
its pedestal the date: 1807, and the words: <i>Purchased
at Arles market</i>; it was of a bluish slate color, and had
on its head three slender black feathers, a foot in length.
Then there were flamingoes galore, for they sometimes
build their nests by myriads in the marshes of Crau,
sitting astride their nests which are as tall as their legs.
And the divers! and grebes! and penguins, which are
seldom seen! And the rascally pelican, called by the
people thereabouts <i>grand gousier</i>!</p>

<p>Livette fancied that she could hear in the distance
the mournful, heart-rending cry of the birds of passage,
rising above the roar of the wind and the sound of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
river shedding its tears into the ocean; dominating
the mysterious sounds that fill the darkness. How
many times had she heard the cries of cranes and petrels
and Egyptian curlews over the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon in
the season when the nights are long, when the sight
of the fire rejoices the heart like a living thing full of
promise, when the blackness of death envelops the
world. The birds remind her also of the Christmas
evenings, the evenings when the logs blazing in the huge
fire-place and the many lamps seem to say: &ldquo;Courage!
the night will pass.&rdquo; And it is then that the wheat
shows its green stalk, saying likewise: &ldquo;Yes, courage!
bad weather, like all other, comes to an end at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Livette mused thus, and mechanically raised her eyes
to the ceiling, from which the crocodile was hanging.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Livette did not say to herself that there was, somewhere
on the other side of the great sea, in the same
Egypt to which Saint Joseph and the Virgin Mary fled
to protect the Child Jesus from the persecution of King
Herod, a great river, the mighty brother of the Rh&ocirc;ne,
and that in the hottest hours of the day, on the islands
in the Nile, the crocodiles crawl in great numbers out
upon the overheated sands to expose their backs to the
rays of a sun as hot as any oven.</p>

<p>She did not say to herself that Saint Sara, the swarthy
patron saint of the gipsies, is called by them the Egyptian,
and that they water their gaunt horses in the Nile
as well as in the Rh&ocirc;ne. She could not say to herself&mdash;because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
she knew it not&mdash;that the Egyptians inherit from
the Hindoos a debased sort of magic, and that it was
the same sort, even more debased without doubt, that
gave Zinzara her power.</p>

<p>Nor did Livette know that Zinzara carried in one of
the boxes in her ambulatory house&mdash;between a crocodile
from the Nile and a sacred ibis, both found in an Egyptian
crypt&mdash;the mummy of a young girl, six thousand
years old, whose face, from which the bandages had
been taken, wore a mask of gold. She could conceive
no connection between the ibis of the Nile and yonder
creature of the same name killed within the year on the
shore of the Vaccar&egrave;s, but she underwent the influence
of all these mysterious connecting currents to which
space and time are naught.</p>

<p>The lifeless creatures, scattered all about her, lived
again by virtue of the power of retaining their form
forever. And fear seized upon her, for suddenly the
mad idea, at once vague and precise, entered her mind
of a resemblance between the profile of the great reptile
hanging from the ceiling and the lower part of the gipsy
queen&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>Livette thought that she must be ill, and rose to go,
determined to wait no longer, but as she put out her
hand to the door she uttered a cry. A centipede was
crawling along the key, as lively as you please. She
recoiled, and saw upon the white wall, at about the level
of her head, a <i>tarente</i>, that seemed to be watching her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
with its pale-gray eyes. The <i>tarente</i> is inoffensive, but
Livette knew nothing of that. It is the Mauritanian
<i>gecko</i>, which abounds in Provence, a reptile repugnant
to the sight, with gray protuberances on the head and
back like those upon cantaloupe melons. And then
the little fellow, the tiny creature, resembles the crocodile!&mdash;Surely,
Livette has the fever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, my child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monsieur le cur&eacute; has entered the room. He has a
kindly air that comforts the poor child at once.</p>

<p>He points to a chair. She sits down and dares not
say a word. Where shall she begin?</p>

<p>He urges her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He closes his eyes, that he may not embarrass her by
his glance, which he knows to be searching. He has
left his spectacles up-stairs on his great book. He closes
his eyes; and with compressed lips, presses his jaws
against each other to a sort of rhythm, so that you can
see his temples bulge out and subside like a fish&rsquo;s gills.
It is a nervous affection. His hands are folded on his
waist; he clasps his fingers and plays at making them
revolve about one another, mechanically; but he is
keenly attentive. Monsieur le cur&eacute; loves the souls of
his fellow-men. He knows that they suffer, that life is
infinite, and that they veer about and call to one another
in the boundless expanse of space and time, like birds
in a storm. He is reflecting. He is a kind-hearted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
priest. He is imbued with the spirit of the Gospel.
He is indulgent. Does he not know that some great
saints have been great sinners? He desires to be kind.
He knows how to be.</p>

<p>What can be the matter?</p>

<p>At last, Livette speaks. She tells him everything; the
gipsy&rsquo;s first appearance, her refusal to give her the oil
she asked for insolently, with jeering remarks about extreme
unction; then of the ominous spell she cast upon
her, realized even now perhaps; the change in her
Renaud&rsquo;s character, his coldness, his flight; and then,
that very morning, the scene of the snakes; how she
had been attracted&mdash;partly by curiosity, no doubt, but
also by her conviction that she should hear something
of Renaud. And how she gave her hand to the gipsy
to have her fortune told! That, she had done against
her inclination! She knew that it was wrong. Who
would have dared say a moment before that she would
commit such a sin? But she was afraid of seeming
cowardly, not because of what the world would say, but
because of <em>her</em>, the gitana, in whose presence she deemed
it her duty to display pride and courage. She felt that
she was very hostile to her. She was afraid of her, and
yet, in her despite, she would defy her. She was the
stronger of the two.&mdash;At last, she arrives at her most
shocking avowal&mdash;she is jealous. A terrible thought has
come into her mind; is it possible that Renaud could&mdash;&mdash;?
But no. Did he not, to save her from Rampal, risk his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
life by leaping down from a first-floor window the whole
height of the house? To be sure, Rampal had stolen a
horse from Renaud, and Renaud had been looking for
him for a long time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Livette is undone. She has glanced at Monsieur le
cur&eacute;, who, before replying, is listening to his own
thoughts, in order not to be diverted from the matter
in hand. He is still playing with his clasped fingers,
making them revolve about one another.</p>

<p>Around them the swans, the pelican, the red flamingo,
the petrel, the ibis, look on with their eyes of glass imbedded
in those heads that have lived! There they
stand, those phantom birds, with wings outspread and
one claw put forward, exactly similar in shape, color,
and plumage to the birds that are soaring above the
Nile and the Ganges, beyond seas, at this moment, and
no less like other birds that lived six thousand years
ago.</p>

<p>The reptile on the ceiling, laughing down at them
with his numerous long, sharp teeth, does, in very truth,
resemble some one a little&mdash;but whom?</p>

<p>Livette, as she puts the question to herself, suddenly
comes to the conclusion that she is insane, utterly
insane, to have had such an idea! She smiles at it
herself. And she seems to <em>feel</em> her smile. She does
feel it. She fancies she can see it!</p>

<p>And at the moment she is conscious of a sensation&mdash;and
a painful sensation it is&mdash;of being there, in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
same room, surrounded by those creatures and in the
presence of a priest&mdash;<em>for the second time in her life</em>!</p>

<p>Yes, all her present surroundings <em>she has seen before</em>&mdash;this
that is happening to her <em>has happened before</em>. But
the first time was a long while ago, oh! such a long
while! The great reptile on the ceiling remembers,
perhaps. That is why it laughs.&mdash;But she has forgotten
<em>all about it</em>. Why is she here? She no longer knows
even that. She was a fool to come here!</p>

<p>This Camargue country, you see, is the home of
malignant fever. It rises from the swamps in the sunshine,
with fetid odors, exhalations that disturb the
brain and the action of the blood. From the dead
vegetation, from the dead water, bad dreams and fever
rise like vapor. There is an <em>evil atmosphere</em> there; and
the <em>evil eye</em> too, thinks Livette.</p>

<p>But who can say of what the mummy lying in Zinzara&rsquo;s
wagon is thinking all this time&mdash;the mummy of
which Livette knows nothing, and which is of the same
age as Livette, plus six thousand years? Like Livette,
it has wavy hair, very long, but somewhat faded by
time. It was once as black as jet like that of the women
of Arles. The mummy is of the same age as Livette,
plus six thousand years! The gipsies believe that so
long as the dead body retains its shape, something of its
spirit continues to dwell within it. Zinzara affirms that
this mummy, which she procured in Egypt, speaks to
her sometimes and tells her things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
Ah! if we should undertake to go to the bottom of
the simplest facts, how they would puzzle us! Our
Saracen mares of Camargue, sisters of Al-Borak, Mahomet&rsquo;s
white mare, and the bulls of the Vaccar&egrave;s, brothers
of Apis, sometimes absent-mindedly take into their
mouths, in the heart of the swamps, the long, gently-waving
stalk of the mysterious lotus that lives three
lives at once, in the mud with its root, in the water
with its stalk, in the blue air with its flower.</p>

<p>Not without reason do the zingari, descendants of
&Ccedil;oudra, flock to the crypt of the three-storied church,
there to adore the shrine of Sara, Pilate&rsquo;s wife&mdash;the
Egyptian woman.</p>

<p>Monsieur le cur&eacute;, who is a profound student, is revolving
all these things confusedly in his mind&mdash;with no very clear
understanding of them himself&mdash;and pondering them.</p>

<p>Ah! if he could, how quickly he would sweep the
island clear of the gipsy vermin! But he cannot. Tradition
forbids. Sara in the crypt is their saint. There is a
mixture of pagan and Christian in the affair, painful to
contemplate certainly, but with which he has no right
to interfere. The essential thing is that the Christian
shall triumph over the pagan, that God shall prevail
against Satan&mdash;for certain it is, whatever the gipsies may
say, that they are not descended from the wise king who
was a negro and who brought the myrrh to Jesus.</p>

<p>How to protect Livette?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not remain alone with your thoughts, my child.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
Carry your rosary always with you, and tell your beads
often, not mechanically but with your whole heart.
Confide your sorrows to your good grandmother, whose
Christian sentiments I well know. That simple-minded
old woman has a great heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Avoid the town. Tell your father&mdash;who has always
done as you wished, nor has he had reason to repent of
so doing&mdash;to have an eye to his house, and never to
leave you alone. Avoid Renaud for some little time;
at all events, do not seek him. He must have an opportunity
to read his own heart clearly; we must not&mdash;by
trying to bring him back to you&mdash;help him to mistake
his affection for you, which is not, perhaps, so deep as
it should be. I will speak to him myself when I have
an opportunity. The day after to-morrow is the day of
the f&ecirc;te at Saintes-Maries. Do not fail to be present;
bring us that day a heart filled with faith and with the
desire to do what is right. You will meet many unfortunates
there. Turn your eyes toward those who are
more wretched than yourself, and by comparing their
lot with yours, you will see how fortunate you are, who
have youth and good health.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The health of the soul depends upon ourselves.
You will save yours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be the one, on the day of the f&ecirc;te, to sing
the solo of invocation just as the reliquaries descend&mdash;I
ask you to do it, and, if need be, I will lay the duty
upon you as a penance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
&ldquo;She who thinks on God and the holy women forgets
all earthly ills. Knock, and it shall be opened unto
you. They who fear shall be reassured. Blessed are
they who weep, for they shall be comforted&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monsieur le cur&eacute; broke off abruptly. He realized,
the kind-hearted man, that his discourse was, by force
of habit, degenerating into a commonplace sermon,
and, rising from his chair, he walked quickly toward
the door, bestowing an affectionate tap on the trembling
maiden&rsquo;s cheek with two fingers of the hand
that held his snuff-box, saying to her in a fatherly
tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go, little one; you have a good heart. The wicked
can do naught against us. I will pray for you at Mass.
Everybody in the country loves you. Have no fear,
my daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Livette took her leave. The cur&eacute;, left to himself,
sighed. He saw that Livette was confronted by an
ill-defined, strange, diabolical peril, of the kind that
cannot be turned aside, that God alone can avert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is fate,&rdquo; he muttered, employing unthinkingly a
word of twofold signification.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> &ldquo;It is fate,&rdquo; he repeated.
&ldquo;Life is a sea of troubles, and God is mysterious.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16"></a>XVI<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">ON THE ROOF OF THE CHURCH</span></h2>


<p>Renaud, after his victory, dismounted for a moment,
and, sitting down beside Bernard, on the shore of the
Vaccar&egrave;s, where the cattle and mares of his drove had
resumed their attitude of repose, he set about reviewing
recent events in his mind.</p>

<p>To overturn his projected marriage, to ruin his future
for the sake of the gipsy, for the sake of the unworthy
passion that was at work within him&mdash;most assuredly
Renaud had no such idea.</p>

<p>When the first fury of his desire was worked off by wild
leaps and bounds, after the fashion of his horse Prince,
he found a way to be reconciled with himself. His
rugged honesty was impaired. He would try to satisfy
his passion for the accursed gipsy when occasion offered;
and that, he felt very sure, would do Livette no wrong!</p>

<p>Like a clever casuist, he combated his own instinctively
honest impulses with arguments which he invented
with much labor, and then complacently refined and
elaborated, playing tricks upon himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
Now that he could boast of having fought Rampal
on Livette&rsquo;s account,&mdash;omitting in his thoughts the other
two reasons he had had for fighting, namely, his determination
to recover the stolen horse and his desire to
display his strength and courage to Zinzara,&mdash;he could
return to the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon with his head in the air,
and meet his fianc&eacute;e again as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Why, after all, should he be ashamed? Had he not
established a fresh claim to Livette&rsquo;s gratitude and the
esteem of her relatives?</p>

<p>He would take poor Blanchet back to her,&mdash;Blanchet,
of whom she was so fond,&mdash;and he could tell old Audiffret
that the stolen horse was once more browsing, with
the drove, on the reed-grass of the estate.</p>

<p>No: after mature reflection, he was sure that there was
nothing that need make him ashamed.</p>

<p>Indeed, when one is not married, is he required to be
so absolutely faithful? And what is a man to do, when
things fall in his way?</p>

<p>The eyes see before one has had an opportunity to prevent
them! Even after marriage, can one refrain from
being moved by the sight of youthful loveliness? Can
one control the movements of his blood? Desire is not
a sin, and so long as Livette knew nothing, so long as
she did not suffer through him, what reason had he, in
all frankness, for self-reproach?</p>

<p>Nothing had come about by his procurement. He
was still determined not to speak to the gipsy woman&mdash;but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
he would be a great fool not to put out his hand if
the golden peach should offer itself to him voluntarily.</p>

<p>And the salt breeze that blew across the rushes,
arousing the passions of the wild cattle, rushed through
his veins, causing the blood to rise in sudden flushes
to his cheeks.</p>

<p>Of what avail against that breeze, which the heifers
inhale with delight, is the &ldquo;I will not&rdquo; of a young
man who feels his youth? The good Lord forgives it
in others. &ldquo;I have been worrying a great deal over
a very small matter of late,&rdquo; thought Renaud. And he
sagely concluded that he would return at once to Saintes-Maries,
to set Livette&rsquo;s mind at rest, as it was his duty
to do first of all, without avoiding or seeking out the
other.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what had Livette been doing?</p>

<p>When she left the cur&eacute;, almost at the same moment
that Renaud was unhorsing Rampal, Livette had no
wish but to take her horse and ride home at once,
without even waiting for dinner.</p>

<p>She felt that she was lost in such close proximity to
the ill-omened gipsies.</p>

<p>Her first thought was that Renaud, if he had overtaken
Rampal, whom he could not fail to master, would
go without loss of time to the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon.</p>

<p>But her second thought was that he would return to
Saintes-Maries to make the most of his triumph. She
knew Renaud well! He was proud of his strength and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
address. He was spoiled by the public at the races,
who applauded with hands and voice, and he loved to
hear the &ldquo;Bravo, Renaud!&rdquo;&mdash;He would return to the
town, yes, he surely would!</p>

<p>He might imagine, indeed, that she, Livette, had
remained there, and return on her account&mdash;and a little
on the other&rsquo;s account, at the same time!&mdash;Ah! poor
child! suspicion was just beginning to creep into her
mind. Just God! suppose that that zingara woman
should fascinate her Renaud!</p>

<p>Livette, having found her horse still tied to the church-wall,
sent him to the stable at the inn and went to the
fisherman Tonin&rsquo;s to share his <i>bouille-abaisse</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did well, Livette,&rdquo; said Tonin, &ldquo;you have
avoided a sharp squall of the <i>mistral</i>. But I know what
I&rsquo;m talking about; it&rsquo;s nothing but a squall, and you
can go home this afternoon quietly enough. It will
be too hot, if anything. But what&rsquo;s the matter, that
you&rsquo;re so thoughtful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Livette heard but little of all that was said at the
fisherman&rsquo;s table, and, after due reflection, returned to
Monsieur le cur&eacute;&rsquo;s after the meal was at an end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you still at Saintes-Maries, little one?&rdquo; he said,
with a sad smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a fright, my father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Livette sometimes addressed the cur&eacute; thus, because of
the custom in confession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fright? how was that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
&ldquo;Suppose they have fought, who knows what may
have happened? <em>Mon Dieu!</em> chance is uncertain, and
that Rampal is so treacherous that Renaud may be the
loser. I would like, with your permission, Monsieur le
cur&eacute;, to go up on the roof of the church at once; from
there I could see Renaud much sooner if he comes back
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The happy thought had come to her of watching her
betrothed, as he himself had, that same morning, watched
Rampal from the wine-shop window.</p>

<p>The cur&eacute; smiled again and good-humoredly took down
the keys of the little staircase that leads to the upper
chapel and thence to the bell-tower.</p>

<p>He left the house, followed by Livette.</p>

<p>At the foot of the great bare wall of the church, so
high and cold,&mdash;a veritable rampart with its battlements
sharply defined against the blue of the sky,&mdash;the good
cur&eacute; opened the small door.</p>

<p>They ascended the stairs.</p>

<p>When they reached the upper chapel, which is just
above the choir of the church, as we know, the cur&eacute;
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will remain here, little one, to offer up a prayer
to the holy women; you can go on alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Livette, without replying, knelt devoutly beside
the cur&eacute; for an instant, before the relics.</p>

<p>The relics were there, behind the ropes coiled about
the capstan, by means of which they were lowered into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
the church, as the little jug from which the lips of the
faithful drank so eagerly was lowered into the miraculous
well below;&mdash;there they were, on the edge of the
opening through which they were launched into space.</p>

<p>Through this window-like opening into the body of
the church Livette could see the chairs systematically
arranged below, and, higher up, the galleries, the pulpit,
and the pictures&mdash;all well-nigh hidden in the dark
shadow, intersected by two rays of light that darted in,
like arrows, through the narrow loopholes.</p>

<p>Away down, below the gallery at the rear, opposite
where she stood, the chinks in the great square door
were marked like fine lines of fire by the sunshine
without.</p>

<p>She gazed for a long moment at the blessed shrines,
and conjured them to turn aside the evil spell that she
could feel about her.</p>

<p>And, do what she would, as she gazed at the shrines,
which had the appearance of two coffins laid side by
side and welded together, Livette was conscious that
her thoughts became more melancholy than ever. Had
she not seen, year after year, some poor, infirm wretch
in despair lie at full length on cushions in the acute
angle formed by the two lids of the double coffin? And
how many of them had been cured? One in fifty thousand,
and only at long intervals?</p>

<p>And yet, what scores of votive offerings that lofty
chapel held,&mdash;pictures, commemorative marble tablets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
crutches, guns with shattered barrels, and small boats
presented by sailors saved after shipwreck! Aye, but
in how many years have the miracles been performed of
which these offerings are the tokens?&mdash;One shudders to
think how many.</p>

<p>And Livette, well content to divert her thoughts from
such painful subjects, left Monsieur le cur&eacute; at his prayers,
and went up on the roof of the church.</p>

<p>The bright glare of the sky, bursting suddenly upon
her, dazzled her. She had to close her eyes; then she
looked down upon the plain. The plain was a flood of
light.</p>

<p>The rascally <i>mistral</i>, that blows three, six, or nine days
at a time when it has fairly buckled down to work, had
simply taken a whim, as Tonin had foreseen. Not a
leaf was stirring now. The sea had not had time to
grow angry below the surface. It was laughing. The
ponds were as smooth as mirrors. The sun shone hotter
than ever in the clearer air.</p>

<p>The swallows and martins circled about Livette&rsquo;s
head, uttering in endless succession shrill, piercing cries
that constantly came nearer and again receded. The
pointed wings of the martins, also called <i>arbal&eacute;triers</i> or
cross-bowmen, brushed against the turrets and shot into
the loopholes like arrows.</p>

<p>Livette looked off into the desert straight before her,
and, not seeing what she expected, she let her glance
wander here and there over the vast expanse, attractive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
but monotonous, which one can traverse, from end to
end, without ever seeing aught but endless repetition
of the same sand, the same tufts of grass, the same
gleaming waters.</p>

<p>From the top of the church the horizon seemed
almost limitless in every direction, for the golden peaks
of the little Alps, vaguely outlined down in the northeast,
seem to be no more than jagged bits of cloud.</p>

<p>When you are looking at them from that point, you
have at your right, to the eastward, Crau and the
<i>sansou&iuml;res</i>, Martigues, and Marseilles beyond the salt
marshes of Giraud, cut into rectangular mounds of
glistening salt. In the west is little Camargue, with its
temporary ponds, its rare groves of pine, its euphorbium
and branching asphodel, and its &Eacute;tang des Fournaux,
the father of mirages, and filled with shells, although it
has no connection with the sea.</p>

<p>In this vast, flat region, the mind and the eye fall
into the habit of looking always to the horizon, embracing
as much space as possible in the hope of finding
some inequality.</p>

<p>But they cannot escape the unchanging monotony,
even less varied than the monotony of the sea, for the
sea changes color, and is by turns black, blue, pale-green,
dark-purple, or golden.</p>

<p>In our desert there are everywhere the same tamarisks,
the same reeds, and&mdash;round about the six thousand
hectares covered by the waters of the Vaccar&egrave;s&mdash;always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
the same horizon lines, nowhere absolutely unbroken,
but almost everywhere festooned with clumps of tamarisks;
the mirage will always show you a pond gleaming
in some spot of the plain where none is to be found;
and the fisherman, walking along the shore, increases
enormously in size as he recedes, because of the refraction.</p>

<p>Sometimes the month of May is as hot in Camargue
as August.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Au mois de Mai<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Va comme il te pla&icirc;t.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Livette was dazzled by the glare, and lowered her eyes
to scan, with her keen glance, the most distant clumps
of tamarisks, to follow the almost invisible ribbon of
the cart-road that leads from the Vaccar&egrave;s to Saintes-Maries.
Her eyes are tired, and scorching in her head.
There is nothing in the landscape to give them rest.</p>

<p>Everywhere the treeless soil exhales a burning breath
that rises in visible vibrations. The spirit of the earth
breaks its bonds and hovers over her. She can see it
ascending in hot waves. Her eyes perceive the transparent
undulations, the heat trembling in the cool air,
the very soul of the interior fire that trembles so to the
sight that one fancies he can hear it rustle. It is the
never-ceasing dance of the reflected light.</p>

<p>Weary of the glare of the plain, Livette turned toward
the sea, but the sea was simply an immense burnished
mirror which flashed back at the eyes, from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
countless facets of its swiftly moving fragments, the glow
of the blazing sky multiplied beyond expression.</p>

<p>When she looked down once more upon the plain, she
saw, about a league away, a horseman trotting briskly
toward the Saintes-Maries. By an indefinable something
in the bearing of that tiny speck she recognized
her Renaud.</p>

<p>So no harm had come to him!</p>

<p>She was on the point of going down again, when suddenly
she forced herself to bide a little there, to see what
he would do when he arrived.</p>

<p>He was already passing the public spring. He turned
to the left, and disappeared for a moment behind the
houses. He was coming toward the church.</p>

<p>From embrasure to embrasure she ran, to follow him
with her eyes; and in a few seconds he rode out into
the square in front of the church, at the foot of the
Calvary erected there.</p>

<p>She leaned over and watched him. Where was he
going? He had stopped. His tired horse was standing
quite still, simply moving his long tail from side to
side to drive away the gnats and gadflies that were
riddling his bleeding flanks with wounds, for, after
the <i>mistral</i>, the gadflies dance! And then? Nothing.
Absolute silence in the vast glowing expanse. Livette
instinctively noticed that the horse&rsquo;s dark shadow, clearly
marked upon the ground, was already elongated, indicating
that it was four o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
She continued to question herself as to Renaud&rsquo;s
attitude&mdash;what was he doing there, standing still like
that?&mdash;when suddenly the sound of a woman&rsquo;s voice
singing floated up to her ears.</p>

<p>In the perfect silence, that voice, clear as a bell, poured
forth outlandish words that neither Renaud nor Livette
could understand.</p>

<p>The zingara sang:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow the romich&acirc;l, the tzigane, to pass. He is the
spectre of a true king. Kingly is his tattered cloak.
A saddle is his throne. Is the whole earth thy kingdom,
Romich&acirc;l?</p>

<p>&ldquo;At B&oelig;renthal they speak the language of the Zend.
Oh! the &Ccedil;oudra would become pope! Thinkst thou it
was the evil-doer who invented evil? Nay, nay; put
not thy trust in God, and remain free, Romich&acirc;l!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Rhine, too, is a Nile. And the Rh&ocirc;ne likewise.
But thy mare prefers to drink in the river of
Ch&acirc;l! The Nile alone can make thy hope neigh aloud,
O Romich&acirc;l!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With her eye, like a migratory bird&rsquo;s, Zinzara had
long before spied Livette perched up aloft between the
crenelles of the church-roof, and, seeing Renaud riding
toward her, she, in joyous mood as always, had begun to
sing, from mere caprice and bravado, within the circle
of the echo of the lofty walls.</p>

<p>Like the serpents at the sound of her flute, Renaud
was fascinated. The gipsy suspected as much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
And when she had finished her song she showed
herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely thou hast killed thy foe, romi?&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;But how is it that I do not see his heart at the point
of thy spear? Thy maiden whose blood is like snow
will ask thee for it ere long. Ah! that was a kiss well
avenged&mdash;for a Christian! For if thy foe still sat in
his saddle, thou wouldst not be in thine, I suppose?
Listen, then, my beauty&mdash;although it be, in very truth,
a crime for us zingari women to deem a Christian fair to
look upon, I must tell thee, none the less: On the honor
of a queen, romi, thou art handsome as a son of my own
race, brave as a highwayman, as fine a horseman as the
best of us, proud as a free man! I regret neither my
anger of the other day, nor my song of a moment ago,
nor the compliment I pay thee now: for I never do
aught save that which pleases me! and my very anger
does me better service than reflection! Adieu, romi,
may thy God guard thee, if He knows me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Livette had heard nothing but the sharp, incisive tone
in which the gipsy spoke; she could not distinguish her
words.</p>

<p>But as Zinzara went away, she took good care, before
she disappeared at the corner of the square, to send a
kiss to the drover with her finger-tips&mdash;a kiss which
seemed to him, because he could see her smile, a bit
of raillery, but which was in Livette&rsquo;s eyes a token of
requited love. Renaud thereupon admitted to himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
that he had returned to Saintes-Maries in quest of nothing
else than this compliment from the gipsy&mdash;something
that drew him nearer to the seductive creature!</p>

<br />
She leaned over and watched him. Where was he
going? He had stopped.</p>

<p>Now he had no choice but to turn back. He preferred
not to see Livette at once! He preferred to
return to the free air of the desert, to set his thoughts in
order, discover his real feelings, reckon up his chances,
and, after that was done, to be left alone with the image
of the gitana, from whom he parted willingly, however,
for he was very glad to be at a distance from her, with
unrestrained freedom of movement, the better to think
of her.</p>

<p>Before leaving the roof of the church, Livette cast a
glance upon the broad expanse of Camargue at her feet.
Ah! how empty was that immense space! The few
scattered houses which would have delighted her eyes
in the plain, were hidden by the clumps of umbrella-like
pines beneath which they stood. Nothing human
replied to the cry of distress uttered by her poor heart,
which longed to follow the bewitched drover into the
desert, and which seemed to her to flutter down from
the summit of the tower to the ground, where it was
crushed by the fall like a bird fallen from its nest.</p>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17"></a>XVII<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE OLD WOMAN</span></h2>


<p>Renaud rode at a foot-pace to the <i>M&eacute;nage</i>, one of the
farms belonging to the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon. He had
ordered Bernard to bring Blanchet to him there, intending
to take him back to the ch&acirc;teau. It was but a short
distance from one to the other.</p>

<p>He was exceedingly astonished to find that the more
he reflected upon what had happened to him&mdash;and it
was really what he had hoped for&mdash;the more dissatisfied
he was.</p>

<p>He believed that he had finally formed, in spite of
everything, a fairly accurate estimate of the gipsy&rsquo;s
character&mdash;a fact that pleased him. He had simply said
to himself that she was an uncivilized creature, since she
could forget all shame of her nakedness in her haste to
punish as best she could a man she deemed overbold.
From her very immodesty, from the arrogance and
malignity she had exhibited at their first meeting, he
had, strangely enough, evolved a proof of chastity so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
sure of itself, so disdainful of peril, that the shameless
creature seemed to him only the more desirable.</p>

<p>He knew that the gipsy women esteem thieves, but
not prostitutes, and he had enjoyed seeing in Zinzara a
sort of savage virgin, ferocious as a wild beast of the
Orient, over whom he, the tamer of beasts, would be
the first to enjoy the pride of triumph. And, lo! she
suddenly aroused in him a feeling of repulsion which he
could not explain. Simply because he had heard her
pronounce a few words, of obscure meaning, like all
gipsy words, and threatening in tone as he ought to expect,&mdash;more
amiable, in point of fact, than he had any
right to hope,&mdash;he believed her, as if it had been revealed
to him in a dream, capable of anything, a <em>wicked
woman</em>! He felt that the devil was in her.</p>

<p>He had no precise knowledge as to her age. Was
she seventeen or twenty-five? The swarthy tint of her
impassive yet smiling face told nothing, hid blushes
and pallor alike.</p>

<p>Her face was extremely young, and its expression
was of no age. Renaud had undergone the inexplicable
fascination of that face, whereon the malignity
born of a woman&rsquo;s experience of the world, false for
the sake of omnipotence, was mingled with something
child-like.</p>

<p>Stronger men than he would have been caught in the
snare. Neither king nor priest could have escaped
the evil fascination of the gitana! She would have had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
but to will. The very things that repelled one were
attractive!</p>

<p>So Renaud was caught, and his manner showed it.
Sitting upon his tired horse, upon the stallion whose fiery
nature was subdued by so much hard riding in all directions,
and who carried his head less high, the drover,
supporting the head of his spear upon his stirrup while
the handle rested against his arm, seemed like a vanquished
king, humiliated by the feeling that he was a
prisoner in the free air.</p>

<p>He found Bernard at the <i>M&eacute;nage</i>, in the huge room
on the lower floor, like those in all the farm-houses of the
province, with the high mantelpiece, the long massive
table in the centre, the kneading-trough of well-waxed
walnut, the carved bread-cupboard with little columns,
fastened to the wall like a cage, and the shining copper
pans. Upon the whitewashed wall a few colored pictures
were hanging: the Saintes-Maries in their boat; Napol&eacute;on
I. on the Bridge of Arcola, and Genevi&egrave;ve de
Brabant, with the roe, in the depths of a forest.</p>

<p>An old shepherd was seated at the table, beside
Bernard, slowly eating his slice of bread.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it you, king?&rdquo; said he as Renaud entered. &ldquo;I
have seen you hold your head higher! What&rsquo;s the
matter with you? you look downhearted. Aren&rsquo;t you
still a cattle-herder, my boy? A shepherd&rsquo;s virtue,
young man, is patience, remember that. What you
can&rsquo;t find in a day you may find in a hundred years.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ah! there you are, Sigaud, eh?&rdquo; Renaud replied,
without answering his questions. &ldquo;When do you start
for the Alps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right away, my son. We are behindhand this
year. I am just getting ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing more was said. When they had eaten in
silence their bread and sheep&rsquo;s-milk cheese, and drunk a
cup of sour wine made from the wild grape, they rose.</p>

<p>The shepherd threw his cloak over his arm, took his
staff from a corner, and having doffed his broad-brimmed
hat before an old image of the Nativity, that hung on the
wall, embellished with a branch laden with cocoons,
and beneath which, on a carved oak stand, stood a little
lamp, long unlighted, he went slowly from the room.</p>

<p>When Renaud, mounted upon Prince and leading
Blanchet, left the <i>M&eacute;nage</i>, he rode some time with the
shepherds, by the side of the enormous flock on their
way to the Alps, where they were to pass the summer
season.</p>

<p>Two thousand sheep, led by the rams, and arranged
in battalions and companies, under the care of several
shepherds of whom old Sigaud was the chief, were trotting
along the road with hanging heads, making with
their eight thousand feet a dull, smothered pattering, as
of falling hailstones, in the dense clouds of dust. The
Labry dogs ran to and fro along the edges of the flock,
full of business, but frequently turning their eyes toward
their master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
A few asses scattered among the different companies
bore upon their backs, jolting about in double wicker-baskets,
the sleepy, bleating lambs.</p>

<p>Old Sigaud was in high feather, thinking of the cool,
fresh air of the Alps, where the grass is green and the
water pure, and where he could gaze in peace every
night at Cassiopeia&rsquo;s Chair and the Three Kings and
the Pleiades in the heavens studded with myriads of
stars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adieu, Sigaud,&rdquo; said Renaud, drawing rein when
the time came for him to part from the flock and its
guardians.</p>

<p>Sigaud also stopped in front of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adieu, Renaud,&rdquo; said he gravely. &ldquo;There must
be a woman at the bottom of your trouble. You are too
sad. But we called you <em>King</em> to do honor to your
courage, you mustn&rsquo;t forget that. Remember, too, that
everything is of some use, my boy, and that good may
come out of evil. It takes all kinds to make the world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Renaud found Livette sitting on the stone bench in
front of the door of the ch&acirc;teau. He had not leaped
down from Prince before she was covering Blanchet
with kisses. Audiffret was very glad to learn that the
stolen horse had returned to the drove, but when Renaud
explained that he had come, on this occasion, to
return Blanchet, Livette showed some feeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are not satisfied with what he has done for
you?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Such a pretty horse! and so clever!&mdash;or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
perhaps you are tired of teaching him for me, of
preventing him from learning bad tricks in the stable,
of training him so that I can have the pleasure of seeing
him return a winner from the races at B&eacute;ziers, where
my father is anxious to send him next month?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Renaud,&rdquo; said Audiffret, &ldquo;you ought to
keep him. He gets rusty here in the stable. But I am
surprised at what Livette says. Why, would you believe
that she was regretting him this very morning, saying
that she proposed to ask you to bring him back to-day.
And now she doesn&rsquo;t want him!&mdash;It takes a very shrewd
man to understand these girls!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But what Audiffret could not understand, Renaud,
for his part, understood very well. The lovelorn damsel
said to herself that, by returning the horse, her fianc&eacute;
would rid himself of a reminder of her, which was a
cause of remorse to him perhaps&mdash;whereas, he ought,
like a jealous lover, to have wanted to look after
Blanchet, and take care of him for her, as long as
possible.</p>

<p>Renaud resisted as best he could. He would have a
deal of hard riding to do at the time of the f&ecirc;tes, he
said, and he did not want to overwork Blanchet or to
leave him with the drove to become wild again.</p>

<p>Thereupon, Audiffret, easily influenced by the last who
spoke, agreed with Renaud.</p>

<p>While the discussion was in progress, Renaud had put
up both horses in the stable. That done, he went slowly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
up to the hay-loft, whence he threw down an armful of
hay into the racks through the openings in the floor.</p>

<p>When he went down again, Blanchet was standing
alone in front of the mangers, nibbling at the hay.&mdash;Renaud
ran to the door. Livette, having removed
Prince&rsquo;s halter, was shouting at him and waving her
pretty arms to drive him away, naked and free. Honest
Audiffret, delighted at his daughter&rsquo;s cunning, laughed
and laughed. And Prince, overjoyed to return to the
desert after these few days of slavery, thinking no more
of the oats to be had at the ch&acirc;teau, stood erect like a
goat, neighed shrilly with delight, shook his luxuriant
mane, flung up his tail and thrashed the air, alive with
the flies he had driven from his flanks&mdash;and darted away
toward the horizon through the lane between the trees
in the park.</p>

<p>Renaud had no choice but to submit with an affectation
of gratitude, and to laugh with the rest;&mdash;but it
was more distasteful to him than ever to ride a horse
that belonged to him less than any other in the drove, a
horse that was his fianc&eacute;e&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Thereupon, Audiffret went about his various tasks;
and, two hours later, when they were all assembled
in the lower room of the farm-house, Renaud, being
suddenly seized with <i>ennui</i> at the thought that he was
likely at any moment to have to endure an embarrassing
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with this same Livette whose company he had
so ardently desired a few days before, spoke of taking his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
leave. Audiffret remonstrated, and invited him to supper.
They would drink a glass in honor of his victory.
Renaud refused awkwardly, conscious how lacking in
courtesy such an utterly motiveless refusal was.</p>

<p>But when the grandmother, who hardly ever spoke,
urged him to stay, he stayed.</p>

<p>The old woman rarely spoke, for her thoughts were
always with the dead and gone grandfather, who had
been the faithful companion of her toilsome life. She
was slowly drying up, like wood that is sound in all its
fibres, but has lost its sap. Hers was a lovely old age,
such as are seen in the land of the grasshopper, where
people live sober lives, preserved by the light. Already
advanced in years when she came to Camargue, she had
never suffered from the malevolence of the swamps. It
was too late. The cypress-tree does not allow the worms
to draw their lines upon its surface.</p>

<p>She was patiently awaiting death, sometimes mumbling
<i>paters</i> upon her rosary of olive-nuts, gazing fearlessly,
with her dimmed eyes, straight before her at the
vague shadow wherein her departed old man, her good,
faithful Tiennet, was waiting for her;&mdash;Tiennet, who had
never, in forty years, caused her a pang, and whom she
had never wronged by a smile, even in the days of her
gayest youth. Tiennet, from the depths of the shadow,
sometimes called to her softly, and then the old woman
would be heard to murmur, in a dreamy voice: &ldquo;I am
coming, good man! I am coming!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
Being left alone for a moment with Livette, just before
supper, Renaud did not know what to say. Nor did she.
He did not dare to lie, and she hoped that he would
open his heart and confess. At one moment, she felt
that the very fact of his silence was sufficient proof of
his treachery, and the next moment, on the contrary,
she said to herself: &ldquo;If there was an understanding
between them, he would not be here! I was mad!
He loves me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At supper, he was very talkative, told about his battles
and his hunting exploits; how, the year before, with
that rascal of a Rampal, he had beaten up two coveys
of partridges, on horseback, in a single morning. They
had taken twenty-eight, more than twenty being killed
on the wing at a single casting of their staves, Arab-fashion.</p>

<p>Audiffret, overjoyed at the recovery of a horse he had
thought lost forever, drew from under the woodpile an
old-fashioned bottle, a gift from the masters, those masters
who are always absent&mdash;like all the landowners of
Camargue, who prefer to dwell in cities,&mdash;Paris, Marseilles,
or Montpellier,&mdash;leaving the desert to their
<em>bailiffs</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! the masters in old times!&rdquo; said Audiffret,
&ldquo;they had more courage and were better served and
better loved!&rdquo; Renaud, becoming more and more animated,
stood up for the times we live in. The grandmother,
grave and serious as always, said once to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
Audiffret at table, speaking of Renaud: &ldquo;Wait upon
your son, my son.&rdquo; Well, well, he was decidedly one
of the family.</p>

<p>And that certainty, which it behooved him to retain
at any price, instead of moving his heart to gratitude,
led him on to play the hypocrite. He was ready to
betray Livette, without renouncing her, for he loved
her so dearly, so sincerely, that he felt that he was ready,
on the other hand, to renounce the gitana, without too
great a pang, if circumstances should make it necessary.
He laughed a great deal, raising his glass with great
frequency, and winking involuntarily at Audiffret, as if
to say: &ldquo;We are sly fellows!&rdquo; But honest Audiffret
could not detect his excitement. He had never interested
himself in anything except the farm accounts.
He had never divined anything in all his life, not he!&mdash;As
far as the gipsy was concerned, she certainly would
not leave Saintes-Maries before the f&ecirc;te, that is to say,
for a week or more. After that, she could go where
she chose! it would make little difference to him.
What could he hope for from a wandering creature
like that? An hour&rsquo;s meeting at the cross-roads on the
way to Arles! Nothing more!</p>

<p>As to Zinzara, he had hopes; as to Livette, he had
certainty. And he was very light of heart.</p>

<p>So it was, that, when the time came for him to take his
leave, he indulged in an outburst of affection toward
his new family, quite contrary to his usual habit, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
the habit of all drovers, who are rough-mannered by
profession.</p>

<p>You must know that the peasants, in general, do not
kiss except on great occasions&mdash;weddings or baptisms.
Only the mothers kiss their young children. The man
of the soil is of stern mould.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Audiffret,&rdquo; the grandmother suddenly said to her
son, laying her knitting on the table and her spectacles
on her knitting;&mdash;&ldquo;Audiffret, every day brings me a
little nearer the end, and I would like to see this marriage
take place before I die. You must hurry it as
much as possible, now that it&rsquo;s decided on. And if I
can&rsquo;t be present on the wedding-day, don&rsquo;t forget, my
children, that the old woman blessed you from the
bottom of her heart to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, without another word, she calmly took up the
stockings and needles.</p>

<p>She had spoken almost without inflection, in a grave,
calm tone, moving her lips only.</p>

<p>Every one was deeply moved. Livette looked at
Renaud. He, carried away by his emotion, forgot
everything except this new family that offered itself
to him, the orphan. Livette saw it and was grateful
to him for it. She felt that he was won back, like
the stolen horse, and she sprang to her feet in a burst
of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kiss me, my betrothed!&rdquo; said she proudly.</p>

<p>He kissed her with heartfelt sincerity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
The father and the grandmother looked on with eyes
that gradually became dim with tears.</p>

<p>When he had pressed the father&rsquo;s hand, Renaud turned
to the grandmother, as she stuck her knitting-needle into
the white hair that fluttered about her temples.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kiss me, grandmother!&rdquo; he said, with a smile.</p>

<p>The old woman gave a leap, then stood erect, recoiling
a little as if in fear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since my husband died, no man has ever kissed
me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;not even my son there! Let young
people kiss. Life is before them. I,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;am
already with the dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that, the old peasant-woman, straight and
stiff and withered,&mdash;the image of a by-gone time, when
it was deemed a praiseworthy thing to remain true to a
single sentiment,&mdash;sought the bed of her old age, which
was soon to see her lying dead, with the tranquillity of
a simple, loving, faithful heart upon her parchment-like
face.</p>

<h2><a name="chap18" id="chap18"></a>XVIII<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE BLESSED RELICS</span></h2>


<p>The great day has arrived. From all parts of Languedoc
and Provence, pilgrims, rich and poor, have come to
Saintes-Maries. There are fully ten thousand strangers
in the town.</p>

<p>For three days past they have been arriving in vehicles
of all shapes and of all ages.</p>

<p>Many of these pilgrims lodge with the villagers at
extraordinary, princely rates. A bunch of straw on the
floor brings twenty francs. The villager himself sleeps
on a chair, or passes the night in the open air on the
warm sand of the dunes. If the bulls arrive during
the night for the sports of the following day, he assists
the drovers to drive them into the compound, in the
wake of the <i>donda&iuml;re</i>, the enormous ox with a bell.</p>

<p>The houses are soon filled to overflowing. New-comers
are obliged to camp. Tents are pitched. People live
in carts and wagons, in breaks, tilburys, cal&egrave;ches, omnibuses,
as far away as possible, be it understood, from the
gipsy encampment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
Around the little town, the hundreds of vehicles constitute
a roving town of their own, resting there like a
flock of birds of passage around a swamp.</p>

<p>And on all sides naught can be seen but tattered,
crippled, hunchbacked, deformed, blind, or one-eyed
creatures, broken in health, lame, maimed, scrofulous,
and paralytic, dragging themselves along or dragged by
others, carried in men&rsquo;s arms or on litters, some with
bandages over their faces, others displaying unhealed
wounds from which one turns aside in horror.</p>

<p>Here a poor fellow who has been bitten by a mad dog
wanders about with gloomy brow, tormented by insane
anxiety and hope, for a pilgrimage to Saintes-Maries is
especially efficacious against hydrophobia.</p>

<p>All varieties of misfortune are represented. All the
children of Job and Tobias have journeyed hither to
find the healing angel and the miraculous fish.</p>

<p>A motley crowd swarms upon the public square in the
bright sunlight, and in the narrow streets, under the luminous
shadow of the awnings. From time to time, it parts,
with loud shouts, before a drover, who rides proudly by,
his sweetheart <i>en croupe</i> with her arms about his waist.</p>

<p>Here and there flat baskets laden with rosaries, sacred
images, Catalan knives, and handkerchiefs of brilliant
hue stand out like islets in the midst of the sea of promenaders,
and all the merchandise displayed for sale takes
on a pink or pale-blue tint through the great stationary
umbrellas that shield it from the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
Amid the fantastic piercing notes of a <i>galoubet</i>, or
high-pitched flute, tambourines can be heard humming
in cadence in the interior of a wine-shop, where young
girls of the province are dancing in Proven&ccedil;al costume,
dark-skinned girls with white teeth beneath their sensuous
lips; very like Moors they are, the descendants of
some Saracen pirate who ravaged the Ligurian shore.</p>

<p>The town is flooded with joyous light. Everybody is
in his Sunday dress. Upon the fever-haunted strand,
whither a whole people flocks to pray to the Saintes
Maries for bodily health, that joyous sun is dangerous.
The whole scene has the appearance of a hospital ball,
a f&ecirc;te given by dying men. The devil wields the b&acirc;ton,
it may be. One would think it, to see the faces of the
gipsies, whose expression, notwithstanding certain cunning
leers, is and remains undecipherable.</p>

<p>In the church with the black, dirt-begrimed walls,
filled with a fetid odor by such an accumulation of
misery, diseased flesh, and perspiring humanity, the
people crowd about the iron balustrade of the little
well, as if it were the Fountain of Youth. The poor,
green, dilapidated pitcher humbly descends at the end
of its cord to bring up from the sand below brackish
water that to-day seems sweet.</p>

<p>Keep faith with them, O saints!&mdash;Faith gives what
one wishes.</p>

<p>They are waiting for four o&rsquo;clock, the hour at which
the relics descend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
At four o&rsquo;clock precisely, the shutter of the high
window up yonder, under the ogive arch of the nave,
will open. The relics will come down toward the outstretched
arms. The little children will be lifted up
toward them. The dead arms of the paralytics will
be raised toward them. The blind will turn toward
them their sightless eyes, or their empty, blood-stained
orbits.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Livette, who is standing there in the
centre of the crowd, directly in front of the altar,
facing the grated door through which you go down
into the crypt, is preparing to sing the solo of invocation.
Her fresh, pure voice is to be the voice of all
these wretched creatures, crushed under the weight of
impurity and disease.</p>

<p>Just below the high altar, which is studded with
tapers, the gipsies are huddled together in their crypt,
with tapers in their hands, invoking Saint Sara. The
vault is dark. The gipsies are black. The little glass
shrine of Saint Sara has become black under the accumulated
filth of years. From the centre of the church
you can see through the grated opening, which resembles
an air-hole of hell, the innumerable twinkling lights of
the tapers below, waving to and fro in the hands that
hold them. A muffled sound of praying comes up
through the opening.</p>

<p>In the church, every hand now has its taper, and they
are rapidly lighted one from another. The lights dance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
about in the air. But the interior of the nave is dark.
The high walls, pierced by narrow windows, are grimy
with age. And all this obscurity, where suffering and
misery crawl and cower, is studded with stars like heaven.
To the gipsies in the crypt, who will not see the blessed
relics descend, the body of the church, which they can
see from below through the air-hole, is a heaven beyond
their reach, the world of the elect.</p>

<p>But the elect, alas! are damned. Their heaven is
the chapel up yonder, in which the power they invoke
lies sleeping, beneath the stained wood of the boxes,
like to a double coffin&mdash;the power that may remain
deaf, the all-powerful power that will never perhaps
awaken for any one, the marvellous power upon which
cures depend and which withholds happiness!</p>

<p>Such was the interior of the three-storied church of
Saintes-Maries on that day. And above the lofty
chapel, there was the bell-tower overlooking the whole
country-side. Surrounded by endless numbers of swallows
and sea-gulls, for centuries past it has looked upon
the glistening desert, the dazzling sea, the dumb infinitude
of space, which could explain things if it would,
but only beams and laughs.</p>

<p>The hour drew near. The crowd was panting with
heat and hope and fear.</p>

<p>Renaud was not there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember&mdash;we promised to burn three tapers each
before the relics,&rdquo; Livette had said to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
&ldquo;I will come to-night,&rdquo; was his reply. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
the branding to-day. I have to look after my bulls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Livette was a little distraught. She was thinking
of joining Renaud, of being present at the branding, of
keeping an eye on her betrothed. Where was he?</p>

<p>But Monsieur le cur&eacute; made a sign: Livette began to
sing. Alas! why was not her lover there? Her voice,
which she knew was pleasant to the ear, might have
some effect on him. How eagerly he listened to the
gipsy&rsquo;s singing the other day!&mdash;Livette sang, and the
buzzing of prayers and litanies and invocations of all
sorts, that every one was indulging in on his or her own
account, subsided as her clear, pure voice arose. O God!
what is this humanity of ours? It is vile and abject,
but it has some sense of shame. The basest know how
to pray that they may be cured of their baseness. And,
however much they may have rolled in the mire of their
natural inclinations, a time comes when they set the
flame alight, when they burn incense, and when all keep
silent to listen to the voice ascending to Heaven, imploring
for them a grace that no one knows, that perhaps
does not exist, but that every one imagines and desires!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eat your excrement, dog!&rdquo; say the gipsies; &ldquo;what
care I? There is a light in the dog&rsquo;s eye that is not
often seen in the eyes of kings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Livette sang. The cur&eacute; said to himself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;O my God, mayhap this child of Thine will obtain
favor in Thy sight!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
Livette&rsquo;s voice was as fresh as the water of salvation
for which the assembled multitude thirsted. And how
intently they listened! But, at the end of each stanza,
weary of restraining their tumultuous ejaculations of
hope, they sent up from thousands of throats an inarticulate
roar in which only the two words: <em>Saintes
Maries!</em> could be distinguished.</p>

<p>Livette sang:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Quand vous &eacute;tiez sur la grande eau,<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Saintes Maries!</em>&rdquo; roared the people; uttered at the
same moment by a thousand voices acting upon a common
impulse, the frenzied appeal was like an explosion.</p>

<p>Every one shouted with all his strength, for the saints
must be made to hear! Every one shouted with all his
lungs, with all his heart, with all his body, one might
say. Heaven is so far away! Open-mouthed, their faces
twitching convulsively, they gazed upward. The veins
in their necks were swollen to the bursting-point. The
muscles swelled and thickened in faces to which the
blood rushed in torrents. The brothers, lovers, husbands,
mothers, fathers, of the sufferers, availed themselves
of their own strength to call for help, howling
like wounded wild beasts turned toward the dawn.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
All this suffering multitude, all this swarming heap of
tainted, diseased flesh, uttered the terrifying roar of a
monster in pain&mdash;and still the preternaturally shrill
shriek of some doting mother would soar above the
horrid uproar. And all around the church, filled with
the nameless appeals of these damned of earth, lay the
calm, silent desert, the blue, foam-flecked sea, the brilliant
sunlight, insensible to everything.</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Saintes Maries!</em>&rdquo; roared the people, and each time
the shout burst forth from thousands of throats, suddenly
and at the same instant, with the effect of a strange kind
of explosion.</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Saintes Maries!</em>&rdquo; the people roared again. And
the appealing cry, made up of so many cries, burst forth
with a sound like that made by a great wave that breaks
against a cliff and is instantly scattered about in foam!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
And again the young girl&rsquo;s voice arose above all the
vociferating, grinning creatures. Might not one fancy
that he saw a sea-swallow, white as the dove of the
Ark, soaring over a bottomless abyss?</p>

<p>And for the last time, the deafening, harsh cry arose:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Saintes Maries!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh! the thousand, two thousand ejaculations of insane
longing that flew upward, at a single flight, flapping all
their wings at once, to fall back, dead, upon themselves.</p>

<p>It is very certain that there was in that frenzied appeal
all the madness of suffering, all the wrath of unsatisfied
longing, and rage as of unchained beasts, against the
very beings they implored.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the double shutter up above had not yet
been thrown open. And Livette, in accordance with
the cur&eacute;&rsquo;s instructions, was to repeat the last verse.</p>

<p>So she began again:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Vous pour qui Dieu fit ce miracle&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But these first words had hardly passed her lips when
her voice faltered and died away. For a few seconds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
there was a silence as of utter amazement in the church.
Of what was Livette thinking? Of what?&mdash;For the
last minute, just God! her eyes had been obstinately
fixed upon the black opening leading to the crypt. In
that opening, on a level with the floor of the church,
she had seen a head: it was the gipsy queen, who had
come up from the crypt, in mischievous mood, curious
to see Livette singing. Immediately below the great
altar she emerged from the dark depths of the cellar
amid the ascending smoke of the tapers. She came from
her kingdom below, and with her copper crown and
gleaming ear-rings, her swarthy skin and her fiery black
eyes, she seemed to Livette a genuine devil from hell.</p>

<p>Zinzara ascended two steps more and her bust appeared.
She darted a keen, penetrating glance at
Livette. That is why Livette was confused, and why
she called with all her strength upon the women of
compassion, the holy women above, for help against
this woman from the chapel below.</p>

<p>But the shutters that concealed the shrines were
opened at last. And slowly, very slowly, they descended,
swinging from side to side, with a slight jerky
movement, at the ends of the two ropes, embellished
here and there with little bunches of flowers.</p>

<p>Is not this the image of every life? Is there aught else
in the world? Something descends from heaven, something
ascends from hell; and we suffer with hope and fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Saintes Maries!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
Amid the vociferations of the crowd, Livette lost her
head, she forgot to sing, and, carried away by the prevailing
excitement, hope, and terror, she began to cry
aloud with all the rest, like a lost soul, while Zinzara,
from below, continued to gaze fixedly at her.</p>

<p>What would you say, Monsieur le cur&eacute;, to Livette&rsquo;s
thoughts, who,&mdash;poor creature of the world we live
in!&mdash;between the holy women and the woman devil,
no longer knew which way to turn? Had she not reason
to tremble? For the shrines descend to no purpose, they
bring us naught but dead relics&mdash;while the sorceress is
a creature of flesh and blood, whose feet walk, whose
eyes see!</p>

<p>Far away from us, in the land of dreams, of supernatural
hopes, above the sky and the stars, are the
sainted souls that have pity for mankind; as far from
man as Paradise itself are the chaste women who embalm
the crucified ones in herbs and spices, while <em>she</em>
is close at hand, always ready, always armed against the
repose of Christian souls, she, queen of diabolic love,
who, seeking only to gratify her caprice, makes sport of
everything!</p>

<p>Livette became more and more confused beneath
Zinzara&rsquo;s steadfast glance, and she tried in vain, after
silence had at last been restored, to resume the invocation.
She faltered and stopped again.</p>

<p>Thereupon there was great confusion among the
waiting multitude. All those men and women who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
were holding their peace in order to listen to the outpouring
of their own souls in the maiden&rsquo;s voice, to
the pure, unspoken prayer which was in their hearts,
but which they could not put in words, had been thrown
back once more, and more despairingly than ever, upon
themselves, upon their own helplessness, when Livette&rsquo;s
voice died away. Just at the decisive moment, their
interpreter failed them! They were afraid of their profound
silence, so contrary to the impulses of their hearts.
In order to be heard on high, their prayer must be
offered; and, seized by the same thought, every one
began to shout or sing on his own account, some beginning
again at the very beginning, others taking the
stanza they knew by heart or had before them in a
book, others repeating at random bits of the litanies,
one the <i>credo</i>, another the <i>pater</i>, and never did prayers
offered up to God create such a hellish uproar, since the
discordant cries of all the sorrows of mankind ascended
to Heaven.</p>

<p>Stronger women than Livette would have been disturbed
as she was, would have felt their powers failing.
She put her hand to her forehead to detain her mind
that seemed to be making its escape. Was not she the
cause of all this trouble? What would become of her,
in this state? She was afraid and ashamed at once.</p>

<p>Instead of looking up, instead of watching the blessed
relics that had now accomplished half of their descent,
she could not refrain from returning the fixed stare of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
the gipsy woman below, whose eyes seemed to pierce
her soul.</p>

<p>Livette suffered keenly. The gipsy&rsquo;s gaze entered
into her very being, and she felt that she could do
nothing. It seemed to her as if a sharp-toothed beast
were gnawing at her heart. Instead of praying, she
listened to the terrible thoughts within her. She fancied
that she could feel the hatred go out from her with the
glances that shot from her eyes! She tried to stab to
the heart with it that creature who was defying her
down there. Would not somebody kill the witch, who
was the cause of everything? Ah! Saintes Maries!
what thoughts for such a place! at such a time!</p>

<p>The relics slowly descended, and, amid the roars that
greeted them, Livette, in her overwrought imagination,
fancied that she saw herself clinging to Renaud, beseeching
him to be faithful and kind to her, and not
to go to that other woman; and when he refused and
left her, she leaped at the gipsy&rsquo;s face and scratched her
and clawed at her like a cat.</p>

<p>Thus the sorceress&rsquo;s soul passed into Livette. Already,
without suspecting it, she had begun to resemble her
enemy, the gitana who leaped at the nostrils of Renaud&rsquo;s
horse the other day. And yet this little fair-haired girl
was not one of the dark-skinned maidens of Arles, who
have African and Asian blood in their veins! No
matter; she, too, has a wild beast&rsquo;s fits of passion.
Love and jealousy are at work making a woman&rsquo;s soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244]</a></span>
The relics were still descending; and Livette feverishly
told off <i>paters</i> and <i>aves</i> on her rosary.&mdash;Patience!
on the day after the f&ecirc;te, the gipsies, she knows, will
leave the town! Two more days and her agony will be
at an end.</p>

<p>Meanwhile&mdash;she makes this vow in presence of the
relics&mdash;she will not gratify Renaud by showing that
she is jealous, as she is, and not until later&mdash;when
Zinzara is far away, and there is no chance of her
coming back&mdash;will she, perhaps, tell her promised husband
that he lied to her, that he is a traitor, because,
instead of avenging her upon the gipsy, he was false
to his fianc&eacute;e with her&mdash;for of course he is false to
her, as he is not there!&mdash;She will tell him, then, not
in a passion, but to punish him. It will be no more
than justice.</p>

<p>By dint of uncoiling themselves by little jerks, the
ropes have lowered the relics almost within reach of
the hands stretched up to meet them. Thereupon the
rabble of poor devils could contain itself no longer.
Every one was determined to be the first to touch them.
Those who were already in the choir, directly below the
hanging relics, lost their footing, crowded as they were
by those who were pressing in from the body of the
church, jostling and crushing one another with a constant
pressure. Livette was borne along on the wave,
seeing nothing, and with but one thought in her mind&mdash;to
touch the consecrated relics herself!&mdash;That she felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
she must do, so that she might escape the influence of
the glance the black woman had cast at her. She
would seek to turn aside the fatal spell that had been
upon her ever since her first meeting with the sorceress!
But would she reach the shrines?&mdash;Livette felt that she
was seized by two strong arms. She turned: it was
Renaud! He had just entered the church with two
other drovers, his friends. These three young men,
glowing with the outside sunlight, healthy and strong,
amid the lame and halt and blind, had the insolent
bearing&mdash;cruel without meaning to be&mdash;of manly beauty,
of life itself. They extricated the girl and made a ring
about her. She was able to breathe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like to touch the relics, demoisellette?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Forcing their way before her, without great effort, but
pitilessly, through the crowd of cripples, they cleared
a passage for her. Livette walked quickly, she drew
near the spot, and Renaud, seizing her around the waist,
lifted her up like a child so that she touched the consecrated
relics first of all!</p>

<p>Still with the three youths as a body-guard, before
whom all were fain to stand aside, and without further
thought&mdash;poor you! it is the law of the world&mdash;of the
innumerable, nameless perils by which she was encompassed,
she left the church content. Peace had found
its way into her heart once more. Her Renaud was
there by her side. Was all that she had dreaded a
dream and nothing more?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ah! it is good to be outside!&rdquo; he said, filling his
lungs with the fresh air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but when will you light the tapers, Renaud,
that you are to burn in the church as I promised for
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I have a whole day before me,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;Now let us go to the races.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap19" id="chap19"></a>XIX<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE BRANDING</span></h2>


<p>The relics having descended, the majority of those
present left the dark church and returned to the dazzling
outside world.</p>

<p>As the crowd poured out through the narrow side-doors,
another crowd was forcing its way in through
the main entrance, making but slow progress,&mdash;two or
three steps in a quarter of an hour,&mdash;all hot and perspiring,
in a cloud of luminous dust.</p>

<p>Many young men were there, for the pleasure of being
pressed by the crowd against the pretty girls, their sweethearts,
whose sinuous bodies they could feel against their
own, and who could not escape them there. How many
hands and waists were squeezed which the mothers could
not see!</p>

<p>And in undertones they said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you, Lionnette.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fie, Fran&ccedil;ois!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go, Tiennet!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus, beside the infirm and incurable, who know
naught of the good things of life, love saucily sports
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
and laughs, feels its own force, and seeks return. The
incense in the church serves only to inflame its desire,
and more than one youth offers his beloved a rosary,
whose boxwood cross he has ardently kissed before her
eyes, so that she may find the kiss with her lips.</p>

<p>All day long, the pilgrims and invalids enter the
church. Many will pass the night there, keeping vigil
with the tapers, on their knees or prostrate before the
relics; and more than one, each in his turn, will lie
down upon them, on cushions brought expressly for
the purpose.</p>

<p>For the moment&mdash;it is the first day of the f&ecirc;te&mdash;nothing
is talked about in the streets of the town save the
bulls and the sports.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to the races?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Prince run? He&rsquo;s the best horse in all the
droves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he won&rsquo;t run; Renaud, who usually handles
him, told me that he was too tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! what a pity!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about the bulls? Shall we have any that are
a bit ugly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s <i>Sirous</i> and <i>Dogue</i> and <i>M&acirc;chicoulis</i>. I cut
them out myself with Bernard and Renaud. They gave
us a lot of trouble! They refused to leave the herd.
As soon as we got them out, back they would go again.
But we set <i>Martin</i> and <i>Commetoi</i> at them, two bull-dogs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
that can&rsquo;t be matched anywhere; and even <i>M&acirc;chicoulis</i>
obeyed at last!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Martin</i> and <i>Commetoi</i>?&mdash;Those are curious names
for dogs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a joke. When any one asks: &lsquo;How is your dog
called?&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The dog&rsquo;s master replies: &lsquo;<i>Commetoi!</i>&rsquo;
[Like yourself.] The other man gets angry, and it
raises a laugh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what about the full-blooded Spanish bull, with
the horns twisted like a lyre; shall we see him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Angel Pastor?</i> He is sick. I like our straight-horned
bulls better. The important thing is that the
horns should be far enough apart for a man&rsquo;s body to
go between them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there any heifers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One, a wicked one&mdash;<i>Serpentine</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And <i>bioulets</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young bulls, do you mean? Renaud has kept six
of them, expressly to give the strangers a chance to see
a branding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When will the branding come off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a moment. Suppose we go to see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gipsy was present at the branding.</p>

<p>The arena was against the church, at the end opposite
the main entrance.</p>

<p>The many-sided irregular enclosure was formed on
one side by the high wall of the church; on another,
by a house standing by itself, against which was a series
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
of roughly made benches, one above another; on still
another side by three or four small houses, each of
whose windows formed a frame for a dozen or more
heads of young men and women, crowded together and
all laughing gaily. At the base of one of these houses
was a caf&eacute; with a glass door opening on the arena and
barricaded by tables and overturned chairs. On each
side of the door was drawn, in deepest black, a silhouette
of a bull of the Camargue type, that is to say, with straight
horns of ample proportions.</p>

<p>On all sides of the enclosure where there were no
stone walls, their place was supplied by wagons bound
firmly together by their shafts.</p>

<p>At the corner of the wall of the church, there were
three great iron rings one above another, and through
them were thrust three wooden bars, which could be
moved back and forth at will.</p>

<p>These bars were to be let down for the young bulls
which were to be turned out of the arena, one by one,
after they had been branded, to find their way alone to
the desert. Outside the bars, a system of barricades
closed the streets of the town to them, and&mdash;by compelling
them to go behind the few houses facing the arena&mdash;guided
them, whether they would or not, to the margin
of the open plain in less than a hundred steps.</p>

<p>Zinzara was present, as we have said, standing in a
wagon. She followed with impassive glance all the happenings
within the arena, grotesque and heroic alike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
These duels between man and beast are grand or
disgusting according to the character of the adversaries.
It sometimes happens that the man attacks in
a cowardly fashion, or that the beast, from astonishment
it may be, or fatigue, turns about and tries to return to
the stable. Fine contests are rare.</p>

<p>Sometimes a sharp stone is thrown from a safe distance
by a disloyal foe. The surprised beast receives
it full in the face; the blood flows in long streams
from his nostrils to the ground. He looks straight
before him, his great eyes filled with mirage, and does
not budge, as if he were at once saddened and contemptuous.</p>

<p>Sometimes a mischievous rascal has the happy thought
of coming very close to him and throwing sand in his
eyes by the handful. Another, more mischievous than
he, covers the bull with filth collected from the gutter!
But the sand-thrower, being spattered thereby, himself
picks up a handful, and the two heroes engage in a fierce
battle with dung picked up smoking from the ground
under the bull&rsquo;s very tail, amid the laughter and applause
of a whole population, until the champions, reeking with
filth, are abruptly separated by the bull, who bestirs
himself at last and charges them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way! this way, Livette!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Livette had just come into the arena. Her young
friends called her and gladly moved closer together to
make room for her on the benches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>252]</a></span>
A stable just beside the caf&eacute; had been transformed
into a <i>toril</i>. Just above the door of the stable was the
long window of the hay-loft, level with the floor. Two
herdsmen, sitting in the window with their legs hanging
outside, rose from time to time, and could be seen
pricking the <i>donda&iuml;re</i>, the beloved leader of the herd,
through the holes in the floor above the hay-racks.
The <i>donda&iuml;re</i> would thereupon go out and lead the
tired bull back to the stable. Every time that a new
beast left the <i>toril</i>, or one that was tired out returned,
a dexterous hand swiftly closed the door.</p>

<p>All these things, which were probably by no means
new to the gipsy, who was doubtless familiar with the
tragic entertainments of Madrid and Seville, left her
unmoved. Her eye did not kindle; it was as dull and
vague as a heifer&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;amateurs&rdquo; played with a few bulls. They were
not ill-tempered. Somebody seized one of them by
the tail. A whole party clung to his skirts, dancing the
farandole&mdash;but were soon scattered. The performance
thus far was not inspiriting, but it was amusing.</p>

<p>Behind the glass door of the caf&eacute;, which opened on
the arena, some congenial spirits were emptying a bottle
and smoking while they enjoyed the spectacle. The
door was barricaded by a rampart of overturned tables,
with their legs in the air and passed through a net-work
of broken chairs.</p>

<p>Suddenly the bull, overturning tables and chairs, put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
the drinkers to flight: he had thrust his bulky head
through a square of glass. The caf&eacute; rang with shouts
of alarm mingled with amusement. The wagons in the
arena shook with the joyous stamping of their occupants;
the planks were torn off by excited hands; the people
at the windows of the little houses rattled the shutters
noisily in their delight. To see the crowds on the roofs
laugh made one fear that they would fall in. Thus was
the frolicsome bull applauded. The gipsy alone did not
smile.</p>

<p>A great oat-bin stood in a corner of the arena, placed
there purposely perhaps. A very old man,&mdash;not too
old to play the merry-andrew,&mdash;armed with an old
red umbrella, raised the lid, climbed into the bin, and
opened his umbrella, which was of the most brilliant
shade of red. The bull rushed at him&mdash;the old man
let the lid fall. Bin and umbrella closed at the same
moment upon the laughing bald head. The hilarity of
the public was at its height. The gipsy did not seem
amused by the old man&rsquo;s drollery.&mdash;Nor did she laugh
when a manikin was set up in the centre of the arena
and the bull carried him off on his horns and hurled
him into the midst of the spectators; and she did not
even smile when, a window on the ground-floor of one
of the houses being thrown open, a little child was seen
in his mother&rsquo;s arms, behind the iron bars, teasing the
furious animal. Laughing with glee, he held a plaything
out through the bars, a little pasteboard windmill,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
whose pink and blue wings were made to turn by the
monster&rsquo;s breath.</p>

<p>Then came a tragic episode. A man&mdash;an <em>amateur</em>&mdash;struck
by the sharp horns; his thigh pierced from side
to side; the first cowardly movement of flight on the
part of the other contestants; the return of the valiant
fellows, who diverted the bull&rsquo;s attention and drew him
off while the wounded man was removed, accompanied
by the piercing shrieks of his wife and daughter.</p>

<p>At last, the serious business of the day began. It was
announced that the branding was about to take place.
Immediately thereafter would come the game of the
&ldquo;cockades,&rdquo; which consists in snatching a cockade
suspended between the bull&rsquo;s horns by a thread. With
his hand or with a hooked stick the rider breaks the
thread, snatches the cockade&mdash;<em>Crac!</em> a quick recovery,
and the victor has won the scarf!</p>

<p>The branding is hard work turned into a game; it
consists in branding young bulls with a red-hot iron,
with their owner&rsquo;s cipher.</p>

<p>A young bull having been turned into the arena,
Renaud walked up to him, and, as the beast made a
rush, cleverly avoided him by turning upon his heel.
The bull having, thereupon, stopped short, Renaud
seized him by the horns.</p>

<p>Clinging to him with his hands, closed like knots of
steel about the horns, the man was dragged for a moment,
standing, over the ground, in which his thick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span>
soles dug ribbon-like furrows. The spectators clapped
their hands. The bull lowered his head and stood still.
Renaud, with his legs apart and bent a little, and his
feet firmly planted in the ground, threw all his weight
to the left. All the muscles of his chest and arms stood
out beneath his shirt, which was glued to his skin by
perspiration. The bull, with all his sluggish strength,
tried to throw himself in the opposite direction. Suddenly
Renaud gave way, and the bull, losing the support
of his resistance, fell heavily before a sudden contrary
effort. And there he lay at full length on the ground,
gasping for breath.</p>

<p>The man, who had not released his hold, forced his
head to the ground by sitting on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo, king! bravo, king!&rdquo; cried the crowd.</p>

<p>Bernard took the red-hot iron from a brazier and
carried it to Renaud, who, thereupon, let go one horn,
and kneeling heavily upon the beast&rsquo;s withers, seized
the iron with his right hand and pressed it against his
shoulder. The hair and flesh smoked and crackled.
Renaud rose quickly, and the bull, springing suddenly
to his feet, shook himself all over, lashed his sides with
his tail, bellowed with anger, pawed the ground with his
foot, and, amid the shouts of the crowd, darted through
the barrier, which was opened at that moment. A moment
later, he could be seen far away on the plain, galloping
at full speed. He soon rejoined the drove which
he or any of his fellows can readily find for themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>256]</a></span>
even if it be on the other side of the Rh&ocirc;ne, which they
often swim.</p>

<p>Six bulls, one after another, were thus thrown down
by Renaud.</p>

<p>The sport enlivened him, he was intoxicated by the
consciousness of his great strength. Excited even more
by the applause of the people, he trembled from head to
foot. From time to time, he wiped the great beads of
perspiration from his forehead with the back of his
hand.</p>

<p>A sunbeam fell across one side of the arena, which
lay in the dark shadow of the high church-wall. Renaud
ran thither, hatless, in shirt-sleeves and close-fitting red
breechcloth, shaking the short curly locks of his thick,
jet-black hair.</p>

<p>The girls applauded, I promise you, more loudly than
the young men, who were somewhat jealous. Zinzara&rsquo;s
eye&mdash;her wagon was standing in the ray of sunlight&mdash;kindled
at last.&mdash;And Livette, blushing deeply, was
proud of her king.</p>

<p>When the sixth bull he had thrown was still under his
knee, Renaud made a sign to Bernard. Bernard ran to
him, knelt beside him, and seized the bull by the horns
in his stead. Another drover came to help Bernard hold
the beast, and Renaud rose.</p>

<p>He walked across the arena, and when he came to
where Livette sat, beckoned to her. Everybody understood
and applauded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>257]</a></span>
She walked forward to the edge of the platform on
which the benches were built, and lightly placed her
foot on the strong cross-bar that served as a support to
the spectators in the front row; from there she jumped
confidently into Renaud&rsquo;s arms, who caught her about
the waist and set her down as if she had been a little
child.</p>

<p>He took her hand and led her toward the bull.</p>

<p>If Renaud had looked at Zinzara at that moment, he
would have surprised in her eyes a gleam which she did
her best to hide behind her half-closed lids. The smile
vanished from her mocking lips.</p>

<p>But Livette and Renaud, the pair of comely lovers,
were thinking of naught but the f&ecirc;te, of themselves, of
this strange betrothal at which all their people were
present, and the like of which not even princes could
give, for it required rare strength and address on the
part of the fianc&eacute;. It was, in very truth, the triumph
of a manly king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo, king! bravo, queen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they passed the brazier in the centre of the arena, he
stooped quickly, and seized with his free hand&mdash;without
stopping or releasing Livette&rsquo;s hand&mdash;the red-hot iron,
which he handed to her as soon as they were beside the
bull. She took it, and, leaning forward, branded the bull
on the shoulder, and when they saw the flesh smoking
under the iron she held in her strong little hand, when
the bull began to quiver with wrath, the enthusiasm of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>258]</a></span>
the people burst forth. Hats and hands and scarfs were
waved in the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo, king! bravo, queen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Renaud, envied by all, escorted the maiden back
to her place, while the bull, set free, rushed from the
arena in his turn and out upon the plain. No, Zinzara
no longer laughed.</p>

<p>The game of the &ldquo;cockades&rdquo; was next on the programme.</p>

<p>The first two or three were easily carried off&mdash;one
from the head of Angel Pastor himself, the Spanish
bull&mdash;by the young men of Saintes-Maries, and it had
not occurred to Renaud to take part in the sport.</p>

<p>At last, Serpentine, a nervous little heifer, was let
loose in the arena. Every one realized instantly that she
was in a bad temper and would defend herself.</p>

<p>Several tried their fortune against her, but, just as
they put out their hand to the cockade, Serpentine
would turn about so quickly, and with such agility for
a heifer, that they fled. Ah! the hussy! Zinzara suddenly
became interested in the game. Renaud had
gone down into the arena.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The king! the king! bravo! king!&rdquo; shouted the
crowd.</p>

<p>And Renaud performed prodigies of skill.</p>

<p>Three times he placed his foot upon Serpentine&rsquo;s lowered
head, and allowed himself to be hurled into space,
to fall again upon his elastic legs. And as soon as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>259]</a></span>
reached the ground the third time, he turned like a
flash, ran straight to the heifer, snatched away the
cockade,&mdash;avoiding the blow she aimed at him with her
horns in her rage,&mdash;and was calmly walking away, when
the agile creature returned to the charge.</p>

<p>Renaud ran, as chance guided him, closely pursued
by the beast, and when he had leaped upon the nearest
wagon, he found himself beside the gipsy, whom he
had instinctively seized around the waist.</p>

<p>The heifer had already turned her attention to some
of the other contestants, and very fortunately, too,&mdash;for
the gipsy, who was standing on the edge of her
wagon, leaning against the insecure boarding, lost her
balance, and leaped down, perforce, into the arena,
carrying Renaud with her.</p>

<p>Livette turned pale as death.</p>

<p>The heifer came galloping back at full speed toward
Renaud and Zinzara, the latter of whom, being entangled
in the folds of her ragged finery, thought that she
was lost.&mdash;Boldly she turned and faced the danger, too
proud to fly, at least when to fly would be useless. But
Renaud had already stepped in front of her to protect
her, and, seized with some insane idea or other,&mdash;the
bravado of a horse-breaker, or of a lover, if you
choose,&mdash;instead of entering into a contest with the
heifer, instead of seizing her by the horns or the legs,
stopped, and, without taking his eyes from the beast&rsquo;s
face, quickly knelt upon one knee, squatted upon his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>260]</a></span>
heel, folded his arms, and, with his head thrown back,
defied her. Like an experienced &ldquo;trapper,&rdquo; he counted
upon the beast&rsquo;s astonishment, and she did, in fact, stop
short, and scrutinize him suspiciously. The gipsy, her
lips pressed tightly together, having regained her place
upon the wagon, looked back and saw her protector
still in that singularly foolhardy attitude. As may be
imagined, everybody was shouting: &ldquo;Vive Renaud!&rdquo;
It seemed as if they would never weary of it.</p>

<p>When he rose, he was again charged by Serpentine,
and had barely time to regain his place of refuge beside
the gitana; and the furious beast attacked the flooring
of the wagon just at their feet with such a fierce blow of
her powerfully armed head, that it was caught there for
a moment by the horns, so that Renaud had to force
them out by stamping upon them with the heel of his
iron-shod boot.</p>

<p>Then the gipsy smiled, and, bending over toward the
drover&rsquo;s ear, whispered a word or two that made
the handsome horse-breaker smile with her.</p>

<p>Livette&mdash;who was a long distance away, at the other
end of the arena, but almost opposite them, and so
placed that she could see them in the bright light&mdash;had
not lost a single gesture, not a single glance.</p>

<p>What jealousy does not see, it divines, and that is not
surprising, for it sees what does not exist.</p>

<h2><a name="chap20" id="chap20"></a>XX<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE SNARE</span></h2>


<p>The relics were exposed twenty-four hours in the
church.</p>

<p>The second day, they reascended to their chapel, amid
the howling of the same poor wretches whose hopes they
carried with them.</p>

<p>At the moment when the relics take their departure,
the spectacle becomes terrifying. What! all is over!
what! they leave us in our misery, our woes sharpened
by the disappointment! And it is all over! over, for
a whole year! And yet the power that can heal is
here, shut up in this box, so near us! among us! They
rush at the shrines and cling to them!&mdash;Nails are broken
and bleeding against the iron-bound corners!&mdash;And the
inexorable capstan up above turns and turns, tearing
from the writhing crowd at the bottom of the well the
strange coffin, that goes up, up, at the end of the straining
ropes. Standing on tiptoe, jostling, overturning,
crushing one another without pity, the poor devils
struggle for the last touch&mdash;the last, supreme touch that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
may, perhaps, because it is the last, secure the coveted
grace.&mdash;And all in vain. Amid the sobbing prayers,
the mysterious closed vessel goes up toward the lofty
chapel, carrying the water of salvation of which so
many feverish lips long to drink. And when the shrines
pass out of sight, near the arch, behind the lowered shutters,&mdash;then
veritable shrieks of agony go up from the
frenzied crowd who cannot endure the death of hope.</p>

<p>Then the uproar becomes truly frightful; then selfishness
breaks forth unbridled, each one uttering for his
own behoof the bestial cry that should bring down on
him alone the saints&rsquo; compassion; then the lamentation
is wild, the supplication horrible to hear, the prayers are
prayers of rage! And in this deep moat, whose walls
tremble with the noise, there is a great uproar as of
unclean beasts, thirsting for their God as for a physical
blessing, as for a vainly awaited promised land! And,
nailed against one of the bare walls of the fortress-church,
a great crucifix, with open arms and upturned
face, above all those distorted faces, all those raised and
writhing arms, seems to mingle with the fierce lamentations
of the human brutes its divine but no less fruitless
and much more despairing cry!</p>

<p>And yet, it is almost always at the last moment, at
the precise second when the shrines disappear, that the
miracle takes place, and a paralytic walks or a blind
girl sees. One cries out: &ldquo;Miracle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucky girl! She is surrounded, almost suffocated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>263]</a></span>
&ldquo;Can you see?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did see.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Can you see
now?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Wait&mdash;yes!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A bright red
lily! a flash! an angel!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Miracle! miracle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man, a villager, immediately takes the child in his
arms. Ah! he has seen miracles before! See how he
hurries to take the child away on his shoulders, on the
shield! He carries her thus so that all may see the
miraculously-cured; so that no one shall forget that
genuine miracles are done at Saintes-Maries, and come
again! And the crowd follows, giving thanks. They
hurry to the parsonage; the miracle is recorded in the
presence of several assembled priests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, I saw!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the procession moves on.</p>

<p>Ah! Christophore, the old pirate!&mdash;How he hurries
along, with his lie on his shoulders!&mdash;He is a poor inhabitant
of Saintes-Maries to whom the presence of so
many strangers every year brings in something, as it
does to all the rest, and he trots joyously off with his
living decoy.</p>

<p>The next day, the child of the miracle is found alone
at the foot of the Calvary, on the beach, left there for a
moment by the woman or child who acts as her guide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, can you see?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What about the
miracle, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor child! In her plaintive voice, she replies:
&ldquo;It has gone again!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;But you did see, yesterday?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;If
you could see, why did they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
carry you?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! monsieur, I couldn&rsquo;t see anything
but flowers, bright red lilies; but as to walking&mdash;oh!
no, I couldn&rsquo;t see to do that! And now it is all dark.
I can&rsquo;t see anything at all any more; yes, the miracle&mdash;has
gone away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as the relics had disappeared, everybody left
the church in procession, to go to bless the sea&mdash;the
sea that bore the saints to Camargue&mdash;the sea whereon
the brave fishermen risk their lives every day.</p>

<p>The cur&eacute; walked at the head of the procession. He
held a relic in his hand; it was the Silver Arm, a hollow
object in which some relics of the saints can be seen
through a little square of glass.</p>

<p>The crowd followed in order. There were hundreds,
yes, thousands of them. Great numbers of pilgrims,
sitting on the dunes, watched the procession winding its
way along the sandy beach where a few flat-boats lay
high and dry.</p>

<p>Behind Monsieur le cur&eacute;, six men bore on their shoulders
a carved and painted wooden image, of considerable
size, representing the two saints in the boat. There
was so much jostling, by so many of the crowd, to secure
the honor of replacing the bearers, that the boat pitched
and rolled on their shoulders as if it were at sea in a
high wind.</p>

<p>Saint Sara, the black saint, came next, borne by dark-haired,
swarthy-faced gipsies, with eyes that glistened
like jet. Their little ones meanwhile glided through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>265]</a></span>
the crowd like rats, creeping between people&rsquo;s legs and
stealing handkerchiefs and purses.</p>

<p>And in the wake of the saints came young men and
maidens, carrying lilies, sweet-smelling lilies, collected
in sheaves every year for the procession of the faithful.</p>

<p>Others held tapers whose light could not be detected
in the bright sunlight, but the lilies filled the air with
perfume. These lilies were Livette&rsquo;s delight.</p>

<p>Monsieur le cur&eacute; reached the water&rsquo;s edge. He held
out the Silver Arm. Thereupon, the sea, for an instant,
recoiled&mdash;only a little. The poor fishermen&rsquo;s wives
quickly crossed themselves.</p>

<p>And all those who were standing on the dunes, watching
the procession pass, saw the bearers marching at
the head loom taller and taller at every step by
reason of the mirage. And the saints on the bearers&rsquo;
shoulders gradually increased in size with them, and
seemed to rise heavenward, of prodigious size, as in a
vision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Protect us, great saints! May the sea be kind to
us of Saintes-Maries this year!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor people, poor souls! Wait till next year.</p>

<p>Every year it is the same thing. All this returns and
will return, like the seasons.</p>

<p>On the day following that on which the relics returned
to their retreat, the majority of the pilgrims left the
village. All the camps were struck at almost the same
hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>266]</a></span>
The carriages of all sorts, the cabriolets, dog-carts,
<i>chars-&agrave;-bancs</i>, <i>jardini&egrave;res</i>, break-necks, the rich farmers&rsquo;
breaks, and the peasants&rsquo; wagons, covered with canvas
stretched over hoops, carried away seven, eight, ten
thousand travellers of all ages, sick or well, and the
long line crawled like a serpent over the flat road between
two deserts. Here and there, at the left of the
line, mounted men, many of whom carried a girl <i>en
croupe</i>, rode back and forth, looking for one another,
now waiting, now riding on at a gallop to take the
lead of the caravan.</p>

<p>This departure of the pilgrims was another spectacle
for the good people of Saintes-Maries, who stood around
in noisy groups on the outskirts of the village, waving
a last adieu to the guests whose presence they had taken
advantage of to the utmost.</p>

<p>Those who had been compelled to give shelter to
friends and had consequently been unable to put so high
a price on their hospitality, good-humoredly repeated
the amusing sentiment, that certainly smacks less of
Arabia than do the horses of the district: <i>Friends who
come to visit us always afford us pleasure; if not when
they arrive, at all events when they depart.</i></p>

<p>On the second day following that on which the gipsy
had smiled upon the drover, when the party of zingari
passed in their place at the tail of the procession, some
mounted on sorry nags, others jolting about in their
wretched wagons,&mdash;some of the women on foot, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>267]</a></span>
better to beg, carrying their children slung bandoleer-wise
over their backs,&mdash;it was observed that the queen&rsquo;s
wagon was not among them.</p>

<p>Zinzara had remained at Saintes-Maries.</p>

<p>She proposed to give herself the pleasure of administering
a rebuff to the drover, with whom she had made
an assignation for that very evening.</p>

<p>This is what had taken place.</p>

<p>During the branding, Renaud had whispered in Zinzara&rsquo;s
ear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! now I have you, gipsy! what a pity that it is
before all these people!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On my word, I have the same thought <em>at this
moment</em>,&rdquo; she replied, deeply touched by the grand
presence of mind he had just shown in defending
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come and speak to you
very soon. These are lovely nights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, to-morrow,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to-morrow, do you
understand? after the wagons have gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But at the close of the performance, when he saw
Livette coming toward him with pale cheeks, so pale
that she looked like a corpse, he was seized with poignant
remorse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She saw me,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;and she is
suffering from jealousy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so great was his pity for the poor little girl that
he felt capable of sacrificing to her, once for all, at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>268]</a></span>
very moment when it had become more difficult than
ever, his insane passion for the other. All the chaste
affection he had felt for Livette from the very first, so
different from passion and so pleasant to the senses,
came back to him like the puff of fresh air that awakens
one from a bad dream.</p>

<p>Furthermore, he was surprised, almost disconcerted,
to find that the gipsy&rsquo;s formal promise did not afford
him the pleasure he had expected when he had dreamed
of it in anticipation.</p>

<p>Livette left him to join her father, who was not to
take her back to the ch&acirc;teau until the evening of the
following day, two or three hours after the departure
of the pilgrims, in order to remain until the end of
the f&ecirc;te, and to avoid the thick dust and the enforced
slowness of the long procession.</p>

<p>And that day&mdash;in the afternoon&mdash;Renaud fell in with
Monsieur le cur&eacute;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, drover. What is the matter, my boy?
You seem preoccupied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! cur&eacute;,&rdquo; said Renaud, &ldquo;sometimes it is difficult
to do what is right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that he was about to pass on, but the cur&eacute; seized
his arm and detained him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh! cur&eacute;,&rdquo; said Renaud, &ldquo;you have still a powerful
grasp!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beware, Renaud,&rdquo; said the cur&eacute; very slowly, &ldquo;lest
you become a great sinner. I know what I know.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>269]</a></span>
Your betrothed wife is weeping. She is jealous. Already
rumors are in circulation concerning you. And
for whom, just God! would you betray that virtuous
girl, who, wealthy as she is, gives herself to you, a
poor orphan? You would ruin a whole family, poor
you! and your honor and the repose of your heart,
forever! The devil is crafty, you are right, and to
do right is difficult, but those whom the devil inspires,
when you follow their momentary caprice and your own
fancy, lead you on to abysses deeper than the <i>lorons</i>
of the <i>paluns</i>. You are walking at this moment on
the moving crust! If it bursts, adieu, my man! You
will be engulfed body and soul. As for yourself, that is
a small matter! but by what right do you compel the
little one to run the risk of your downfall? You are
dealing with an accursed creature, a woman who does
not know herself, who is submissive to nobody, and who
cares nothing for the misfortunes of others. Whatever
she does is for her own amusement. I have seen her
and watched her. The saints have taught me many
things. Beware! The little one is brave. Some day
there may be innocent blood on your hands, if you
keep on in the road I forbid you to follow, for the
devil is in the affair, I tell you, and all sorts of monsters
are awaiting you at the turning in the evil road. A
betrothed lover&rsquo;s infidelity, like a husband&rsquo;s, lays an
egg filled with ghastly creatures, which sometimes
hatches. If you have a heart, show it, Renaud, take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>270]</a></span>
my advice, and go back to your horses and cattle in the
solitude of your plains, where the malignant fever is
less to be feared than the disease you are taking here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Renaud, the tall, strong, dashing blade, listened to
these wise words, hanging his head, poor fellow, like a
child scolded for not knowing his catechism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are a man, make up your mind at once, and
give me your word as a true-hearted drover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take my hand, Monsieur le cur&eacute;. I give you my
word. I was in a fair way to go wrong. A spell was
on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men exchanged a grasp of the hand.</p>

<p>The cur&eacute; walked away with an anxious heart. He
knew that Renaud was sincere, but he knew the strength
of man&rsquo;s passion and his ingenuity in lying.</p>

<p>So the cur&eacute; had been asking questions?&mdash;In that case,
to consort with the gipsy was to risk a rupture with
Livette.</p>

<p>Renaud was about to leave the village,&mdash;or, if you
please, the town,&mdash;with his mind firmly made up to
renounce the gitana. Yes, he would sacrifice her to
Livette, to his earnest desire to have a peaceful, happy
home and a family, he, the wandering cowherd, the
orphan, the foundling of the desert. That was happiness;&mdash;a
roof to shelter one, a roof whose smoke one
can see from afar on the horizon, thinking: the wife and
little ones are there.</p>

<p>He would renounce the gitana; yes, but he proposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
to make known his resolution to her himself. At the
thought of leaving Saintes-Maries without <em>seeing her
again</em>, for the purpose of telling her that he would not
<em>see her again</em>, a weary feeling came over him; it seemed
to him that he was suddenly shut up in a narrow space,
and left there without air, without horizon.&mdash;But he
would see her again&mdash;he must. It would be better so.
Must he not soothe her anger first of all? She would
be angry enough in any event. Why exasperate her?&mdash;In
very truth, if he did see her again, it was&mdash;he reached
this conclusion after much thought&mdash;it was principally
in order to protect poor Livette against her! Yes, yes,
it was for her sake that he would see her again. See
her again! At those words, which he repeated softly
to himself, a joy in living, in moving, in breathing, took
possession of him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Zinzara, for her part, was vowing inwardly
that she would enjoy a hearty laugh at the
drover when he should presently seek her out!</p>

<p>Why, in that case, had she answered <em>yes</em> to his amorous
questions? Oh! because at the moment when he
whispered them in her ear, if she had been able, upon
the spot, to give herself to this savage, all aglow from
his conflict with bulls and heifers, doubtless she would
have done it. He had awakened desire in her, as heat
awakens thirst, as a summer evening awakens longing
for a bath.&mdash;And then it had given her pleasure to say
to herself that, over at the other end of the arena, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>272]</a></span>
woman to whom he had paid queenly honor by giving
her the smoking, red-hot iron, like the sceptre of a
magician or a wicked zingaro king,&mdash;that that woman
was suffering torments.</p>

<p>But he came too late. The desire had passed away.
And the acme of delight to her now lay in the thought
of refusing the promised favor to the Christian she
detested, while giving Livette to believe that he had
been false to her.</p>

<p>Sitting upon a stone, alone, at some distance from her
wagon, she awaited the drover. Her resolution to take
vengeance by refusing was written upon her compressed
lips, whose smile became more malicious than ever when
she saw him riding toward her.</p>

<p>A few steps away he stopped. As he looked at her,
he felt a sudden rushing of the blood in all his veins,
a strange, delicious pressure at the pit of the stomach.
He recognized the characteristic agitation of love; but
he made an effort, and said, in a voice which he felt
to be unsteady: &ldquo;I expected to be free to-night, but
I am not. The master has sent for me, and I must be
far away from here by night-fall. So I must go at once.
Adieu, gipsy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zinzara understood instantly that he was running away
from her, and why!&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;She rose, like the serpent that
rises on its tail and hisses with anger. All her harsh
resolutions vanished in a twinkling; and, in a short,
sharp, jerky voice, entirely different from her natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>273]</a></span>
voice, she said: &ldquo;I want you, do you hear? No one
else shall give you orders when I have orders for you.
What I want done is done. Are you going to act like
a coward, pray&mdash;you, who have taken my fancy because,
when you are on your horse, you resemble a zingaro
who knows neither master nor God? Come, go on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus, the same motive of passionate hatred,&mdash;as
pleasant to her taste as love,&mdash;that a moment before
induced her determination not to go with Renaud, now
threw her into his arms. And to him the love or hatred
of such a woman, at the moment when she gave herself
to him, was one and the same thing; were there not
still her passion, her animated features, her gleaming
eyes, her lips that, as they moved, disclosed two rows
of pearly, sparkling teeth? Was there not her flexible,
ballet-dancer&rsquo;s body, significantly held out toward him
to whom she laid claim?</p>

<p>A thrill of savage joy shook Renaud from head to
foot; and, as his rider shuddered, as if he had been
touched by a cramp-fish, the horse seemed to experience
a similar sensation, and pawed the ground an instant,
between the knees that involuntarily pressed closer to
his sides.</p>

<p>What was he to do? Ah! blessed saints! His betrothal
had kept him virtuous for a long while, you
know; had held him aloof from the frail damsels with
whom he formerly consorted, and his youth was speaking
now. The sea-bull must have the wild heifer. Lions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>274]</a></span>
that have loved gazelles, so says the Arabian legend,
have died of it. Living creatures, by the law of nature,
crave paroxysms of passion; so long as they have them
not, they seek them; and pay for them, if need be, with
their own and others&rsquo; blood. Who of us will blame
them for becoming delirious sometimes, if we remember
that life longs to live, and that that longing overshadows
the fear of death?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, go on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The queen uttered love&rsquo;s command. And with one
bound she jumped to the saddle behind him. In a
twinkling she had wound her right arm about the horseman&rsquo;s
waist: &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; she said again; and then, in
an undertone, in a voice that was no more than a warm,
speaking breath upon the man&rsquo;s neck, and made him
shudder to the very roots of his hair, she added: &ldquo;I
want you, do you understand? I want you! So go on,
go on! The man who goes on, arrives!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was caught, fast bound. The sorceress&rsquo;s arm was
about his loins. He felt it against him, living, trembling,
stronger than aught else.</p>

<p>The stupefied Renaud tried to regain his self-control,&mdash;to
shake off the spell. He sat there, dazed, unable to disentangle
his thoughts, to determine what he should do,
trying to collect his ideas of a moment before, the good
cur&eacute;&rsquo;s advice, his word of honor, none of which could
he remember or repeat to himself in his mind, intelligibly.
It had all gone from him, out of reach of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
effort of his memory. When an intense amorous passion
guides our movements, it is as legitimate as physical
force,&mdash;honor is not betrayed: it has ceased to exist!</p>

<p>Those few seconds of hesitation afforded Zinzara
perfect comprehension of what was taking place within
him. His desire was no longer ardent enough to satisfy
her pride, since it was possible for him to waver ever so
little!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; said she, resuming her sharp,
jerky tone, in which there was a suspicion of a hiss.
&ldquo;Where are we going? You must know of a hiding-place
somewhere, some deserted cabin in the midst of
your swamps here,&mdash;a perfectly safe place, all your own,
where you have taken other women&mdash;what do I care?
<em>Pardi!</em> I don&rsquo;t suppose that you waited for me, to
<em>learn</em>! I will go wherever you take me. Remember
this&mdash;it must be somewhere where nobody can find me,
for my race doesn&rsquo;t mix with yours: the zingara who
gives herself to a Christian is the only despised one
among us, and if one of our people should see me, there
would be knives in the air, you may be sure, for you and
for me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He still hesitated, remembering that he had reasons
for hesitation, but unable to remember what they were.
Mechanically he held back his horse (it was Blanchet!),
who was acting badly.</p>

<p>At last, in the hurly-burly of his thoughts, he seized,
at random, upon one thing he had entirely forgotten,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>276]</a></span>
the tapers promised by Livette to the Saintes Maries. He
was to have lighted them devoutly in the church, during
the night before or that morning. Yesterday his fianc&eacute;e
had reminded him again of the promise. Doubtless,
Livette had lighted them for him, but that was not the
same thing. And so the devil had him, do what he would.
He lost his head. He felt that he was sliding down an
inclined plane, and finding his struggles of no avail, he
abandoned himself to his fate and hastened his fall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know where we will go,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;to the Conscript&rsquo;s
Hut, in the swamp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he was forced to reply, but he no
longer felt any internal revolt against that obligation&mdash;far
otherwise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it far?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, in Crau, on the other side of the Rh&ocirc;ne, near the
Icard farm. The devil couldn&rsquo;t find me there. Rampal
might come there, no one else&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said she at that name, with a sudden gleam
in her cat-like eyes.</p>

<p>She whistled.</p>

<p>He said to himself that some one from Saintes-Maries
would certainly see them, and that Livette would learn
the whole story&mdash;that it would be better now to start at
once.&mdash;Or perhaps&mdash;who knows?&mdash;the delay was a good
thing! Livette might pass, herself, and all would be
changed. He would hasten to her side. They would
be saved. Who would be saved? and from what? from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
a vague, terrible thing that was before him. He could
not have told what it was; but it was simply the renunciation
of his own will.</p>

<p>The gitana&rsquo;s clear, shrill whistle summoned a little
zingaro of some ten years, a veritable wild cat, who
came running to the horse&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>From the saddle she said a few words in the gipsy
language to him, in a short, imperative tone of command.
The gipsy language is composed of German,
Coptic, Egyptian, and Sanscrit. Renaud listened without
the slightest suspicion of the meaning of the words.</p>

<p>In a fit of amorous hatred, the swarthy queen said to
the little fellow:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know Rampal, the drover? go and find him.
He is in the village; I saw him not long ago. Go at
once and tell him this: he will find me to-night, with
his enemy, whom you see here, in the Conscript&rsquo;s Hut,
which he knows! And I will join you and the wagon
to-morrow evening, in the town of Arles, by the old
tombs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She thought of everything. The wild cat disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say to him?&rdquo; Renaud inquired.</p>

<p>She began to laugh, an insolent laugh.</p>

<p>He felt that he abhorred her, that he would delight
to see her conquered, under his heel, absolutely in his
power, gipsy queen and sorceress that she was, like an
ordinary woman.</p>

<p>Each desired the other in hatred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span>
She laughed as she thought that the man about whom
her arms were thrown like a lover she was luring to his
destruction. That very night&mdash;before or after the joys
of love; what cared she for that?&mdash;there would be between
him and that other a struggle as of wild beasts,
which she longed to see; a witches&rsquo; carnival of love, to
rejoice the souls of the dead; and she laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Queens,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;cannot leave their kingdoms
without issuing secret orders. Come, my beast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was she speaking to the man or the horse?&mdash;To the
man, doubtless, in whom she had awakened an animal
like herself.</p>

<p>She pressed him tighter, and again she whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He felt the vampire&rsquo;s breath playing in the short hair
on his neck and descending in hot flushes to his feet,
which were nervously tapping his horse&rsquo;s flanks. Renaud
trembled. His passion had taken possession of
him once more in all its intensity. It seemed as if a
hurricane were raging in man and horse alike. They
started off at full speed.</p>

<p>Renaud believed that he had a victim in his grasp,
but he was himself the victim, and he rode away with
the witch clinging fast to him&mdash;as the kite sometimes
flies away with the serpent, thinking that he has mastered
it, only to be strangled in its folds at last.</p>

<h2><a name="chap21" id="chap21"></a>XXI<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">HERODIAS</span></h2>


<p>They galloped across the plain. At every step, Renaud
felt the gentle pressure of the woman&rsquo;s arm. Zinzara
and Renaud galloped away upon Livette&rsquo;s horse!</p>

<p>Of what was the drover thinking? Was she girl or
woman? His pride made him persist, in spite of himself,
in wishing that she might be the former, although
it seemed hardly probable, heathen females mature so
early!</p>

<p>A breath of air blew in their faces. It brought to
their nostrils the pungent smell of tamarisk blossoms.
He slackened his horse&rsquo;s pace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on, go on!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;press on! We will talk
later&mdash;by ourselves, romi, where nobody can see us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The horse darted forward afresh.</p>

<p>Renaud was conscious of a vague yet overmastering
feeling of pride in being there, in trampling the grass
of the plain with four feet, in knowing no obstacles, in
having that woman close beside him&mdash;and, over yonder,
another!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>280]</a></span>
One would run risks and be false to the traditions of
her race for his sake. The other, if she should know,
might die of the knowledge. And, although he loved
her, the thought caused a thrill of savage joy, but he
promptly repressed it. Luckily, however, she would
know nothing of it. And he became intoxicated with
the rapid movement and with pride, man and beast
combined, fairly launched upon his mad career.</p>

<p>Magnificent was the sky, studded with more stars than
the dunes have grains of sand and the desert waving
flowers clinging to the twigs of the <i>saladelles</i>. The
Milky-Way was as white as the pyramids of salt seen
through the morning mist. One would have said that
a vast bridal veil, torn in strips, was floating above the
whole plain, alive with murmurs of love.</p>

<p>Innumerable little snails were perched, like blossoms,
upon the stalks of the reeds, and swung to and fro.</p>

<p>A very gentle breeze was blowing and raising a slight,
uncertain ripple along the edges of the marsh, with the
sound of a furtive kiss among the flowering rushes. At
times, a lark or a flamingo, asleep among the reeds or
in the shallow water, would awaken ever so little and
chirp to let his mate know that he was there, not far
away.</p>

<p>June is no hotter. Sometimes the smell of roses filled
their nostrils, coming in long puffs from far-off gardens.
Yonder, in the park of the Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon, the
Syrian tree was sending forth its pollen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>281]</a></span>
Renaud, after skirting the sea for some distance, rode
due northeast, beyond the pond of La Dame.</p>

<p>He was bound for Grand-P&acirc;tis. The people at Sambuc
had some boats that he knew of.</p>

<p>For a moment, they rode beside a drove. Bulls,
standing in water up to their thighs, hardly noticed,
were feeding on the flowering reeds. White mares fled
at their approach, followed faithfully by stallions anxious
not to lose sight of them. The sap of May was
flowing in the reeds and rushes, in the sambucus and
tamarisk. The very water exhaled a saline odor, stronger
than usual, and more heavily laden with desires. The
wild vine called to its mate, that came borne upon
the heavy breath of the blooming desert.</p>

<p>Again Renaud stopped, seized with a mild, pleasurable
vertigo.</p>

<p>The fresh, love-compelling breeze in which they were
bathed laid an imperious command upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get down,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;get down at once! This is
a good place to rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she remembered the order she had given.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must go where we were going,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I
will not get down until we are there. We must cross
the Rh&ocirc;ne, you say? Press on, press on!&mdash;Gallop!
The gipsy loves the horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She would have none of his caresses except at the
place appointed. She would not submit to him until
they should be where he was, by her agency, in danger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>282]</a></span>
of death or suffering. A kiss under other circumstances
would be a triumph for him, and she gave herself to
him for her own pleasure alone. She desired to feel,
in the interchange of caresses, that the moisture of her
lips was poison, that her bite would cause death or
madness.</p>

<p>Firmly seated <i>en croupe</i>, still clinging fast to the
drover&mdash;her victim&mdash;with her arm wound about him,
her bare legs hanging in the folds of her skirt which the
wind raised as they sped along, with her head thrown
proudly back, she swayed gracefully with the rocking
motion of the gallop; and her face, which had a sallow
look in the moonlight against the neck of the man
whom she was leading astray, albeit she seemed to be
carried away by him&mdash;her face was wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>When Herodias had obtained the head of John the
Baptist, she lifted it by the hair from the gold charger,
whereon it lay with a circle of blood around the neck,
raised it to the level of her face, and after gazing upon
it with deep interest, examining the closed eyelids and
long lashes and the transparent pallor of the cheeks,
she suddenly placed her mouth upon that lifeless mouth
and sought to force her tongue between the lips to the
cold teeth too tightly closed in death, esteeming that
kiss, inflicted on her dead foe, more delicious than the
incestuous caresses for which he had reproved her.</p>

<p>What was left of Renaud&rsquo;s suspicions of Zinzara,
while she was smiling in the darkness, and the warm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>283]</a></span>
breath from her lips was playing upon his neck? He
had ceased to reflect; he rode on. He willingly postponed
the longed-for hour, now that he was forced to
go on. He thought no more of violence. His happiness
was secure. He could wait. In the midst of the
deserted plains, still warm from the sunlight though
refreshed by the night air, love came without calling,
but he enjoyed the anticipation more than anything
he had known.&mdash;And then she might escape him even
now. He must be careful not to startle her. When they
reached the nest yonder, he would keep her there some
time. And so he rode on, inhaling the saline air of
the desert, which was his&mdash;with his stallion&rsquo;s four shoeless
feet trampling through the sand and water, which
were his also&mdash;bound for the horizon, which would soon
be his.</p>

<p>Once, however, in the midst of a swamp, where the
water was above his horse&rsquo;s knees, he stopped again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>Renaud turned his head, and throwing himself back,
called her with a smacking of his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I am ready!&rdquo; said Zinzara in a mocking
tone.</p>

<p>As she spoke, Blanchet leaped forward, with all four
feet in the air, and made a tremendous splashing in
the water, which fell about their heads in a heavy
shower.</p>

<p>And, unseen by Renaud, the gipsy smiled against his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>284]</a></span>
neck, as she replaced in her hair the long gold pin she
had plunged into the beast&rsquo;s flank.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a shout of <i>Qui vive?</i> directly in
front of them, so unexpected in the solitude, that
Blanchet jumped again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Qui vive?</i>&rdquo; the voice repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The king!&rdquo; Renaud replied gaily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! is it you, Renaud?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the revenue officers; but Renaud hurried by,
at a safe distance, so that they might not recognize the
gitana.</p>

<p>They were near the salt spring of Badon. The rectangular
heaps of salt seemed like so many long, low
houses, with sharp roofs. In its shroud-like whiteness
the spot resembled a little town, geometrically laid out,
asleep under dead snow.</p>

<p>They reached the shore of the main stream of the
Rh&ocirc;ne.</p>

<p>Zinzara was on the ground before Renaud had stopped
his horse.</p>

<p>He alighted in his turn, and handed the rein to the
gipsy. She held Blanchet while he was drinking in
the river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for some oats!&rdquo; said Renaud.</p>

<p>He took a small sack that was fastened across his
saddle-bow, from holster to holster, and at Zinzara&rsquo;s
suggestion emptied it into her dress which she held up
with both hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
Poor, poor Blanchet! there was only a handful of
grain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait for me; I&rsquo;ll go to find the boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Renaud disappeared in the darkness behind the reeds
and willows that grew along the bank, drowned in the
mist, floating like pallid spectres in the darkness.</p>

<p>Zinzara heard nothing save the plashing of the
water, and the crunching of the oats between Blanchet&rsquo;s
teeth, as he swept them up with his long lip
from the hollow of the dress.&mdash;Oh! if Livette could
have seen that!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I am, come!&rdquo; said Renaud&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>He approached, raising the oars. She walked to the
water&rsquo;s edge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold the reins fast. The horse will follow us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stepped into the boat and stood in the stern.
Blanchet followed, in the wake.</p>

<p>Renaud knew the current at that spot. He rowed
diagonally across and reached the other shore more
than a hundred yards farther down.</p>

<p>He tied the boat to the trunk of a willow and tightened
the girths, and they were off again.</p>

<p>It was necessary to ascend the stream a long distance
to find a place to ford the canal that runs from Arles
to Port-le-Bouc. When they had crossed the canal,
he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are almost there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had ridden nearly five hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>286]</a></span>
His desires were approaching fruition. He was seized
with the impatience that comes with the last half-hour.
He had a vision of what was to come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is in the <i>gargate</i>,&rdquo; he said. And he explained:
&ldquo;The <i>gargate</i> is like thickened water. It is about the
same as mud. The cabin we are going to is in the midst
of one of these patches of mud. Ah! we shall be well
protected there, gitana, I promise you. A man once
lived there for a long while; a conscript who wanted
to evade the draft. And later, an escaped convict, a
native of the neighborhood, who knew about the place.
No one could dislodge him there. Others know the
spot; but never fear, I have a way to fool them. Trust
me, gitana, we shall be well guarded there, by death
hidden in the water around us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They reached their destination.</p>

<p>Renaud tied his horse to a tree, and took Zinzara&rsquo;s
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The moon was rising. With the end of a stick, he
pointed out to her, just above the surface of the water,
the heads of the stakes, looming black among the stalks
of thorn-broom and reeds and the broad, spreading
leaves of the water-lily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always step to the left of the stakes,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;they mark the right-hand edge of the solid path just
below the surface of the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Renaud had taken off his shoes and stockings. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>287]</a></span>
lifted her skirts and walked with bare legs, and he held
her hand. They walked thus for some time. Her
interest was aroused by her surroundings. The place
pleased her.</p>

<p>The water was disturbed a little here and there. She
stopped and watched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turtles,&rdquo; said he; and added: &ldquo;Here is the
cabin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cabin stood in the midst of the bog, built on
piles, as was the path leading to it. Reeds and a few
tamarisks surrounded it, and made it invisible from
almost every direction. On the gray, thatched roof,
shaped like a hay-stack, the little cross gleamed in the
moonlight, bent back as if the wind had tried to blow
it down.</p>

<p>The back of the cabin was turned to the <i>mistral</i>.
They entered. Renaud took a candle from his wallet
and struck a match. The light danced upon the walls.</p>

<p>The low walls were of grayish mud, set in a rough
frame-work. The floor was covered with a bed of
reeds. A cotton cloth, to keep out the gnats, hung
before the door. There was a stationary table against
the wall at the right, near the head of the bed; it was a
flat stone supported by four pieces of timber fastened to
the floor.</p>

<p>Renaud set his candle down on the stone. The
gitana, already seated on the rough bed, watched him
with a savage look in her eyes. She began to feel that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>288]</a></span>
she was a little too much in his power, that it was a
little too much like being under his roof.</p>

<p>The cabin was like all the cabins in the district.
From the ceiling bunches of reed blossoms hung like
waving silver plumes. The big cross-timbers of the
ceiling were pinned together with wooden pegs, the large
ends of which projected, and some few scraps of worn-out
clothes were still hanging from them. There was
a fire-place in one corner, made of large stones placed
side by side, and in the roof, directly above it, was a
hole for the smoke.</p>

<p>Renaud hung his wallet on one of the pegs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, wait for me,&rdquo; he said, with a loud laugh,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out to attend to the horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was surprised, but after she had glanced at him,
she could think of nothing but Rampal.</p>

<p>He went out to Blanchet, removed the saddle and laid
it on the ground, then mounted him, bareback, and
rode him to a pasture some distance away, where he
hobbled him and left him.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later, Renaud returned, with
his saddle across his shoulders, to the cabin where Zinzara
was awaiting him. But, as he walked along the
solid path, a black ribbon covered by a sheet of shallow
water, he took up the stakes that marked one edge of
the path, and moved them from the right side to the
left;&mdash;so that, if that beggarly Rampal, the only man
likely to follow him to that lair, chose to come there,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>289]</a></span>
he certainly would not go far, but would remain there,
buried up to his neck at least!</p>

<p>When he had changed the position of the first twenty
stakes, the only ones visible from the shore of the bog,
Renaud stood up and walked swiftly toward the cabin.
His heart at that moment was sad, and more filled with
slime and noxious things than the waters of the swamp,
which, though they glistened in the moonlight, were
black beneath the surface.</p>

<h2><a name="chap22" id="chap22"></a>XXII<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">IN THE NEST</span></h2>


<p>In the contracted cage, whose thatched roof, with its
peak of red tiles, shone in the moonlight amid the marsh
plants, the two beasts of the same species, Zinzara and
Renaud, were shut up together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am hungry,&rdquo; said she, in a hostile tone.</p>

<p>He took a tin box from his wallet and raised the
cover; it contained the wherewithal to support life; he
cut the bread and uncorked the bottle.</p>

<p>She ate silently, still with the savage look in her eyes.
He waited upon her, partaking also of the dry bread
himself, and putting his lips to the flat bottle, filled with
the strong wine of the wild grape.</p>

<p>When they had eaten, he handed her a small flask of
brandy. She drank from it, joyfully, and soon her eyes
began to sparkle. He looked at her, ready to embrace
her. She answered him with a glance so mocking and
unfathomable, that he hesitated, waiting for he knew
not what, weary besides, and feeling that his brain was
confused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>292]</a></span>
He saw her thereupon take her tambourine, which she
wore fastened to her belt by a small cord, under her
dress; and she began to play upon it. She was sitting
on the bed. She struck regular, monotonous blows upon
the vibrating skin, and at every blow the charms depending
from the tambourine jangled noisily.</p>

<p>Then she began to sing outlandish words, in slow
measure, beating time with the tambourine. And this
proceeding at length fascinated the drover, who gazed
at her, as completely under the spell as the lizard
listening to the locust in the sunshine on a summer&rsquo;s
day.</p>

<p>This lasted an hour. He watched her, enchanted,
proud, thinking of nothing but her, and he felt his heart
leap and quiver in his breast at every touch upon the
tambourine.</p>

<p>But one would have said that she had drawn about
herself a circle that he could not cross. He waited until
the circle should be broken. He was like one of the
great dogs trained to guard droves of bulls; that are so
fearless of blows from the horns of their charges, but sit
obediently by watching their master at his meals, waiting
for the crumb he tosses them, slaves of the king, of their
god, who is man.</p>

<p>She had now the effect upon him of a genuine queen,
a queen in some fairy tale, with her studied attitudes
accompanied by the monotonous music, which was accentuated
by the ceaseless motion of the sequins of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>293]</a></span>
crown of copper against her swarthy brow and the dead
black of her hair.</p>

<p>Suddenly she laid her tambourine aside. He started
toward her. She held him back with a stern glance,
and snatching away the silk handkerchief that covered
her shoulders, appeared before him in a rich waist of
many colors; and he saw upon her breast necklaces
of gold pieces&mdash;her fortune.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Await my pleasure,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Leave me in
peace a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She covered her head with the ample handkerchief
she had taken off and remained hidden behind that veil
for a moment. Renaud heard her muttering unfamiliar
words&mdash;<i>morm&ocirc;</i>, <i>gorg&ocirc;</i>&mdash;words of sorcery, without doubt.</p>

<p>When she threw back her veil, she was laughing.</p>

<p>What vision had the sorceress evoked? what had the
seer seen?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be better than I hoped!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Now,
look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose, and to the accompaniment of the jangling
of the sequins in her diadem and the gold pieces of
her necklace, set in motion by her slow dance, in the
course of which she did not move from where she stood,
she removed her garments, one by one.</p>

<p>By the flickering light of the candle, that waved back
and forth as a breath of air came in through the door,
Renaud watched the familiar vision reappear.</p>

<p>Zinzara swayed this way and that as she unfastened,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>294]</a></span>
one after another, her waist, her skirts&mdash;and took them
off, bending gracefully forward and backward, raising
her arms above her head or lowering them to her
ankles. And now you would have said it was a bronze
statue, glistening in the half-darkness. Renaud knew
that figure well, from having seen it one day in the
bright sunlight, and so many, many times since then,
in his imagination.</p>

<p>The necklace tinkled upon her swelling breasts;
several large rings were around her ankles, and upon
her brow, the crown from which the trinkets hung.</p>

<p>She turned and twisted gracefully about, her dark
skin gleaming like a mirror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;Zinzara gives herself, no man
takes her, romi. The wild girl belongs to no one but
herself. And even now I could, if I chose, nail you
where you stand, forever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke, she threw down upon her clothes a
keen-edged stiletto that had gleamed for an instant in
her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>They lay, side by side, on the floor of that hovel,
upon the crackling reeds.</p>

<p>At that moment, he looked into the depths of her
eyes, and he saw there vague things by which he had
already on several occasions been profoundly alarmed.
The gitana&rsquo;s hidden purpose, as to which she herself
had no clear idea, flickered uncertainly in her glance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>295]</a></span>
making its presence felt, but giving no hint by which
it could be divined.</p>

<p>Her smile, which was ordinarily visible only at the
corner of her mouth, had spread, more unfathomable
than ever, over her whole face, which wore an expression
of triumphant mockery. More mysterious she appeared
and more desirable. If Renaud had been familiar
with the carved stone animals that lie sleeping in the
Egyptian desert, he would have recognized their expression,
an expression that words cannot describe, upon
the speaking face that gazed at him and called him.</p>

<p>And, lo! the hatred he had once before felt for that
face, for that glance, returned swiftly, imperiously, to
his mind; an irresistible desire to seize the woman by
the neck and choke her with cruel, unyielding hands.</p>

<p>Even that feeling was love, for otherwise it would
have occurred to him to part abruptly from the sorceress,
to fly from her; that thought would have come to him,
once at least, and it did not come. On the contrary,
he felt that he could not really possess her except by
some violence of that sort. Is it not true that mares
look upon bites as caresses?&mdash;She saw the thought in
his eyes, and began to laugh.</p>

<p>Again she recognized distinctly, and with delight,
the brute like herself that she had aroused in him.
And she did it to demonstrate her power to subdue
the brute, with a look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! you may!&rdquo; she said, with a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>296]</a></span>
As she spoke, he caught a rapid glimpse of the part
she was to play in his destiny: the pollution of his life,
the loss of real happiness, of all repose, and the false
love&mdash;the strongest of all passions.</p>

<p>Their glances, laden with amorous hate, met and
struck fire like knife-blades.</p>

<p>He seized her around the neck and was very near
choking her in good earnest; he thought that he would
strangle her. &ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; she said in a languishing
voice; but, suddenly feeling the pressure of the
hand that was really squeezing her throat, she leaped
up at him, and, with a strangled laugh, hurled her mouth
at his and bit his lips. They could hear their teeth
clash. He uttered a cry which was at once stifled, for
their angry lips had no sooner met than they were
appeased.</p>

<p>She gazed at him for a long while, looking always
into his eyes. She saw them more than once grow dim
and sightless, and then, exulting in the thought of this
wild bull&rsquo;s weakness in her hands, she laughed silently;
but no emotion dimmed the brightness of her eyes.
Suddenly, when he had grown calmer, a profound sigh
caused him to look with more attention at the savage
creature he had conquered at last. A pallor as of the
other world overspread her swarthy face; her features
were distended. She was no longer smiling. The
wrinkle that ordinarily raised one corner of her lips
and gave her an air of mockery had vanished. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>297]</a></span>
corners of her mouth, on the other hand, drooped a
little, imparting a sad expression to her face. One
would have said she was a different being. There was
no trace of animation upon her features. She no longer
belonged to herself. An attack of vertigo had taken
away her power of thought. She was like a drowned
woman drifting with the tide. Something as everlasting
as death had proved stronger than she.</p>

<p>As if from the midst of one of those dreams which,
in a second, open eternity to our gaze, she returned to
herself with amazement.</p>

<p>The snake-charmer realized that she had been defeated
in a way she was unaccustomed to; she experienced a
curious sensation of shame, a sort of proud regret that
she had forgotten herself as never before.&mdash;And was he,
without even suspecting the trap she had set for him,
tranquilly to carry off the gratification of his passion
with which she had baited the trap? In that case she
would have betrayed herself! She would be the victim
of her detested lover! of Livette&rsquo;s betrothed!&mdash;The
mere thought was intolerable to her. And in a frenzy
of rage and humiliation she put out her hand and felt
among her clothes that lay in a pile near by, for the
stiletto she had insolently thrown upon them just before.</p>

<p>Renaud understood only one thing; the beast was
becoming ugly again! He seized her wrists and held
her arms to the ground, crossed above her head, and
then he began to laugh in his turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>298]</a></span>
Her insane rage came to the surface; she writhed
about and tried to bite, but could not. She felt that
her power was gone, that she was in the hands of one
stronger than herself. Without understanding her, he
felt that she was dangerous and he mastered her. The
Christian had her in his power! It was too much. She
felt her eyes bursting with the tears that were ready to
gush forth, but she forced them back. A little foam
appeared at the corner of her mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dog!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>At that, the man whose face she saw above her own,
bending over and rising again quickly, touched her lips
with his. And he had the feeling that the hand that
grasped the stiletto relaxed its hold.</p>

<p>At that moment, a wailing cry rent the air above the
cabin, then ceased abruptly, before it had died away in
the distance, as if the bird that uttered that signal of
distress had lighted among the reeds near at hand, and
had at once become mute.</p>

<p>Renaud took his eyes from the gitana&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A curlew flying over!&rdquo; she replied, without moving.&mdash;&ldquo;The
curlew goes south in winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Renaud was on his feet, pale as death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;King,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;do you love your queen? Then
look at her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, as she lay upon her back, she began to make
her snake-like body undulate and gleam like a mirror,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>299]</a></span>
keeping time with her tambourine, which she held above
her head.</p>

<p>The bursts of laughter with which she punctuated the
outlandish music displayed her glistening teeth from end
to end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come back here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;are you afraid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was ashamed, and, returning to the straw pallet,
resumed his r&ocirc;le of subjugated watch-dog in love with a
she-wolf.</p>

<p>In that one night, the young man felt the whole power
of his youth, learned more of life and realized more
dreams than many real kings.</p>

<p>The pleasures of love are no greater to the prince
than to the charcoal-burner.</p>

<p>The day was breaking. Bands of violet along the
horizon changed to pink and then to yellow. An
awakening breeze passed like a shiver over the desert
of sand and water, entered the cabin, and blew out the
flickering light on the stone table.</p>

<p>A cock in the distance welcomed the dawn.</p>

<p>Thereupon, Renaud started to go to find his horse.
The wallet was empty, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the Icard farm,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I can get what I
need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that I intend to stay
here all day like a captive goose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it all over, then?&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and are you going
away, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>300]</a></span>
&ldquo;To return may be a pleasure,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but to
remain is always a bore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hummed in the gipsy language:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;God gave thy mare no rein, Romich&acirc;l.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;If you choose,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;we will ride together
till night. My horse has wings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Renaud. &ldquo;Do you cross over
to solid ground first. We will go together and get my
horse. It will be a fine day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a good one! be sure of that!&rdquo; said she, in
her jerky voice, her voice which resembled <em>another&rsquo;s</em>.</p>

<p>He went with her as far as the first of the stakes he
had displaced, to point out the safe road to her, and
when he saw her reach the edge of the swamp sixty feet
beyond, he stooped and began to put the stakes in place
one by one as he walked toward the firm ground.</p>

<p>When he reached the last, he sprang to his feet with
haggard eyes.</p>

<p>Livette, with head thrown back, face turned toward
the sky, eyes closed, mouth open, and grass mingled
with her straying hair, was lying among the water-lilies,
as if asleep, and in the throes of a bad dream. He
also saw her two little clenched hands, above the water,
clinging to the reeds.</p>

<p>Transformed for a moment to a statue, Renaud soon
aroused himself, and, bending over Livette, put his hands
under her armpits. The poor body, buried in the thick,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>301]</a></span>
black ooze, came slowly forth, torn from its bed like the
smooth stalk of a lily.</p>

<p>When he had the poor body in his arms, inert and
cold, perhaps dead,&mdash;the body of the poor, dear child,
whose skirts, entangled in a net-work of long grasses,
clung tightly to her dangling legs,&mdash;Renaud suddenly
uttered a roar as of an enraged wild beast, and ran like
a madman at the top of his speed to the nearest farm-house.</p>

<h2><a name="chap23" id="chap23"></a>XXIII<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE PURSUIT</span></h2>


<p>One forgives only those whom one loves; only those
who love forgive. Love at its apogee is naught but
the power of inspiring forgiveness and bestowing it;
and the social laws, which are of the mechanism of
human justice, seem to have realized that fact, since
they ignore the testimony of all those who would naturally
be expected to love the culprit.</p>

<p>Sympathy is simply a laying aside&mdash;in favor of those
we love&mdash;of the implacable severity which we use but
little in dealing with ourselves, and which attributes to
those who pass judgment an unerring wisdom which is
not human, or a self-confidence which is too much so.</p>

<p>Livette, as she lay sick upon the best bed in the
Icard farm-house, already had, in her sorrowing heart,
an adorable feeling of indulgence for Renaud, which
would have made the blessed maidens who laid the
Crucified One in his shroud, smile with joy in the mystic
heaven of the lofty chapel. She believed that she
would die by her fianc&eacute;&rsquo;s fault, and she pitied him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>304]</a></span>
Forgiveness sooner or later redeems him who receives,
and consoles him who accords it. In the sentiment of
compassion is hidden the divine future of mankind.</p>

<p>Renaud was still ignorant of Livette&rsquo;s indulgence.
Indeed, he could not deserve it until he had come to
look upon himself as forever unworthy.</p>

<p>For the moment, he had not gone to the bottom of
the hell of evil thoughts.</p>

<p>When he found Livette half drowned in the <i>gargate</i>,
his first impulse, born of true love and pity for her, in
absolute forgetfulness of himself, lasted but an instant&mdash;but
it had existed. Renaud at first suffered for her and
for her alone.</p>

<p>His second impulse, almost immediate, and praiseworthy
still, although there was a touch of selfishness in
it, was to condemn himself, through fear of moral responsibility.
Had he not with his own hand displaced
the stakes that marked the path, with the idea, indefensible
at best, that Rampal would be misled by that
treacherous method of defence? Yes, almost immediately
after he uttered his cry of agony, he shuddered
with terror at the thought of the remorse that was in
store for him, as soon as he felt that Livette was like a
dead woman in his arms.</p>

<p>When he had given her in charge of the women at the
main farm-house of the Icard farm, where there was great
excitement over such an adventure at that time of day,
he questioned two old peasant-women who knew more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>305]</a></span>
than all the doctors in the province. After doing what
was necessary for Livette, they cheerfully declared that
the poor girl would not die of it; they even said that it
was &ldquo;nothing at all.&rdquo; He did not even try to understand
how she had come so far to fall into the trap!</p>

<p>She would not die! That was the essential thing at
that moment. What a relief <em>to him</em>, for he was already
accusing himself of his little sweetheart&rsquo;s death! He
had been so afraid! And it turned out to be only a
warning! God be praised, and blessed be the mighty
saints who had performed such a miracle!</p>

<p>But the devil rejoiced when he looked into Renaud&rsquo;s
conscience, for he saw the course his ideas were about to
take, a course that would lead him from bad to worse.</p>

<p>Reassured as to Livette,&mdash;and as to himself,&mdash;he flew
into a passion with the accursed gitana, the indirect
cause, at least, of all this misery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! the beggar! I will kill her!&mdash;it will be easy
to find her again. She can&rsquo;t be far away&mdash;I will kill
her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His wrath took full possession of him&mdash;he ran for his
horse. Kill her!&mdash;kill her! Nothing could be more
righteous.&mdash;And he went about it.</p>

<p>Poor Renaud! the victim of all the involuntary falsehoods
which, starting from ourselves, one engendering
another, sometimes render the best of us irresponsible
and drive us on to disaster when passion makes us
mad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>306]</a></span>
This chain, often undiscoverable, of false but specious
reasons with which men deceive themselves, each fitting
into the last without violence, each explaining and justifying
the one that follows it&mdash;leads insensibly to acts
incomprehensible to him who is not able to follow it
back, link by link. It is the chain of <span class="smcap">Fatality</span>, in
which the links, consisting of trifling but suggestive
facts, of decisive circumstances, unknown sometimes to
the culprit, alternate with the fictitious good motives
he has invented for his own benefit in the reflex movements
of his mind. To re-establish the logical sequence
of facts, of sensations suddenly transformed into ideas,
is the work of equity which reasons, or of love which
divines. In default of tracing back the chain of insensible,
imperious transitions, we find between the criminal
who has long been an honest man and his crime,
the abyss at sight of which fools and unthinking folk,
filled with the pride of implacable sinners, never fail to
exclaim: &ldquo;It is monstrous!&rdquo; But if God, infinite Love,
does exist, everything is forgiven, because everything is
understood; there are, mayhap, simply the miserable
wretches on one side, and divine pity on the other.</p>

<p>Yes, Renaud would have killed the sorceress, with
savage joy, to avenge Livette. But was not that desire,
which he deemed a praiseworthy one, simply a pretext
for seeking her out again that same day, for seeing her
once more?&mdash;That, at all events, is what the devil
himself thought as he crouched on the floor of the crypt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>307]</a></span>
in the church of Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, on the spot
occupied the day before by the dark-browed gipsies,
beneath the shrine of Saint Sara.</p>

<p>And so, mounted upon Blanchet, Renaud galloped
furiously away upon his tracks of the night, intending
to kill Zinzara.</p>

<p>Livette would not die!&mdash;That idea caused him great
joy, so great that he was no sooner out-of-doors, away
from the painful, wearisome spectacle of the poor unconscious
child, than he yielded, alas! to the influence
of the bright sunlight, and breathed at ease. He had
already ceased to think of Livette&rsquo;s sufferings. His
satisfaction had already ceased to be anything more than
selfishness: not only would he not have to reproach
himself for her death, but, more than that, now that
she knew everything, was he not absolved, as it were?
There was nothing more for him to fear. The worst
that could happen had happened! And he actually
felt as if a weight had been taken from his shoulders,
as if he were once more sincere in his dealings with
Livette, a better man, in short, thanks to what had
happened. Although he did not reason this out, the
thought went through his mind. It was what he felt.
For everything serves the passion of love; it turns to
its own profit the very things that would naturally tend
most to thwart it. Moreover, he need feel no qualms
of conscience, as he was going to chastise the malignant
creature, to kill her, in fact:&mdash;a vile race!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>308]</a></span>
No, she could not be far away. Doubtless, if she
had planned the catastrophe, she had concealed herself
near at hand to see the result.</p>

<p>He rode back toward the bridge over the canal. No
one had seen the gipsy there. He descended the Rh&ocirc;ne
to the spot where they had left the boat the night before.
The boat was in the same place, fastened by the same
knot.</p>

<p>He began to fear that he might not find her. But
when, after searching two hours, he was certain of it,
he was much surprised to find that he did not feel the
righteous wrath of the officer of justice at the thought
of a culprit eluding the vengeance of the law, but the
sudden distress of a betrayed lover. He did not cry
to himself: &ldquo;I shall not have the pleasure of punishing
her!&rdquo; but: &ldquo;I shall never see her again!&rdquo; And that
cry burst forth in his heart as a fierce revelation of
unpardonable, pitiless love. What! he loved her! he
loved her! and he learned it for the first time at that
moment! he admitted it to himself for the first time!&mdash;yes,
beyond cavil he loved her&mdash;<em>now</em>! His heart
failed him. He was bewildered. He felt a vague sense
of well-being, due to the mere joy of loving, marred
by a feeling of intense chagrin at the thought of the
certain misery that lay before him. He was horrified
at himself, and, at the same moment, decided upon his
future course in a frenzy of excitement.</p>

<p>The physical power of love is superb and appalling.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>309]</a></span>
It stops at nothing. And the man who is watching
beside the dying or the dead, even though it be some
one who is dear to him, feels a thrill of joy rush to his
heart, if the being he loves with all the force of his
youth passes by.</p>

<p>Renaud had just held Livette almost dying in his
arms, and already he had no regret save for the other,
for the woman he should have trampled under his feet!</p>

<p>Thereupon, all the events of the night returned to his
mind, and finished the work of poisoning. He could
not be reconciled to the thought that he should never
again see what he had had for so short a time. No, it
could not be at an end. If she were a criminal, why
then he would love her in her crime, that was all! The
black bull was loose.&mdash;But Livette? aha! Livette? a
swan&rsquo;s feather, or a red flamingo&rsquo;s, under his horse&rsquo;s
hoof.</p>

<p>What was the placid affection the young maid had
inspired in his heart compared to the frenzy of sorrow
and joy the other caused him to feel? Sorrow and joy
combined, that is what love is; and the love men prefer
is not that which contains the greater joy as compared
to the keener sorrow&mdash;it is that in which those emotions
are most intense. It was that law of passion to whose
operation Renaud was now being subjected. He realized
that he had definitely chosen the other, the gipsy,
despite the cry of his outraged sense of honor.</p>

<p>That cry of his honest heart, to which he no longer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>310]</a></span>
lent a willing ear, he still heard, do what he would, and
he suffered half consciously, for many reasons which he
did not distinguish one from another, but which resulted
in producing a confused feeling in his own mind that he
was a monster.</p>

<p>A monster! for now that he considered the matter
more carefully, it became his settled conviction that the
gitana had intended to kill Livette&mdash;and yet it was
that same gitana that he loved!</p>

<p>Ah! the witch!&mdash;She had certainly seen Livette, her
poor little head, like a dead woman&rsquo;s, lying on the
water among the grass, her mouth open for the last cry
for help, her teeth glistening with water in the sunlight!
She could not have helped seeing her.&mdash;And she had
passed her by without a word!&mdash;It was because she was
determined to be her ruin. She had evidently led her
into the trap. How? What did it matter! but it was
no longer possible to doubt that it was the fact.</p>

<p>But in that case&mdash;if she was really guilty&mdash;there
could be no doubt, either, that having seen her desire
accomplished, she had fled. She would appear no more!
he would have no opportunity to kill her! he would
never see her again! And the thing that moved him
most deeply in connection with Livette&rsquo;s misfortune was
the thought that it involved Zinzara&rsquo;s flight. He tried
in vain to put away the abominable regret; it returned
upon him like a wave. What! he should never see her
again!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>311]</a></span>
Oh! those caresses of the night before in the cabin
of the swamp were clinging to his arms and legs like
serpents. They twined about his body as creeping
plants about the branches of the tamarisk, or as one
eel about another: biting at his heart. And he shivered
from head to foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! the witch!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Ah! the witch!
What! never again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Never again!&mdash;Why, did he not think that night that
he should be able to keep her on his island; that it
would last a year at least, until the next year&rsquo;s f&ecirc;tes;
that he would have the wild beast to himself in the
desert, in his wild beast&rsquo;s lair&mdash;all to himself, with her
lithe, graceful body, her ankle-rings and bracelets, and
her beggar queen&rsquo;s crown?</p>

<p>But did she not love him? Had it all been mere
trickery and craft on her part?</p>

<p>The horse&rsquo;s blood flowed freely under the drover&rsquo;s
spurs; but the horseman&rsquo;s heart was bleeding within
him a thousand times more cruelly.</p>

<p>All mere trickery and craft! He repeated it again
and again to himself, and would not believe it.</p>

<p>That she was false to the core, he firmly believed,
and, by dint of thinking about it, soon ceased to believe
it. That would have been too horrible, really! His
self-pity and the feeling that he must be proud of her
forced back the thought, which, driven away for a
moment, returned again at once with more force as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>312]</a></span>
a sure, proven, established fact. It returned like a flash
of light which hurt his eyes. Yes, yes, she was false
to the core! yes, from pure wantonness the woman had
deceived him again and again since the day of the
bath, when she exhibited her naked body to him with
the deliberate purpose of leading him astray, of leaving
him, some day, stranded in the desert, without his
fianc&eacute;e, without his love&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>And he struggled desperately to see her again&mdash;in his
memory at least&mdash;in order to question her crafty features,
but, try as he would, his mind was unable to restore the
picture, drowned as it was beneath a wavering, irritating
mist. He opened his eyes to their fullest extent, as if,
by causing them to express a fixed determination to see
her again, he could compel her to appear before him in
flesh and blood. And he no longer saw the trees or
the moor that lay before him, or the sky or the horizon,
but neither did he see her whose image he sought to
evoke. Then he suddenly closed his eyes, and for a
brief second&mdash;in the darkness&mdash;he caught a glimpse of
her. Was it really she? He had not time to recognize
her. Once, however, the image became clearer,
and he <em>saw</em> her; but still it was only a shadowy face,
still veiled with falsehood and impenetrable to him.</p>

<p class="caption">She went to the farther end of the All&eacute;e des Alyscamps,
between the rows of tall poplars, amid the stone monuments,
and lighted a fire of twigs, to give her light
enough to look about and select a spot where she could
sleep comfortably.</p>

<p>What he was seeking was her real face, <small>WHICH DID
NOT EXIST</small>, for a face is the expression of a soul, and
she had no soul. Had she ever loved him? that is
what he would have liked to ascertain, if nothing more.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>313]</a></span>
Had she smiled on Rampal? Perhaps&mdash;God! could it
be possible? Who knows? Of what was she not capable
to consummate her crime?&mdash;And yet he secretly
admired her for the extraordinary perfidy he attributed
to her. The Saracen blood, the blood of heathen pirates,
did not flow in his veins for nothing.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, if, in her hate-inspired work, she had had
need of Rampal, with whom he had several times seen
her talking, was it not possible that she had given herself
to him in order to make him absolutely submissive
to her will? What was he thinking of? Given herself
to him? No, not that!&mdash;Not in its fullest meaning,
at all events&mdash;but she might have let him steal a kiss&mdash;a
long kiss, perhaps&mdash;from her lips. And the herdsman
felt the keen point of the spear of jealousy pierce his
heart.</p>

<p>He thought and thought, feverish with passion, excited
by his excessive exertions for several days past,
and he rode through the fields and swamps, amid the
grass and stones of Crau, surrounded by buzzing insects
maddened by the heat, which was terrible.</p>

<p>Great God! only the night before, he had believed
that she had a veritable woman&rsquo;s passion for him, a
passion like those he had often aroused in women, with
his strength, his courage, and his prowess as horse-breaker
and cavalier. And as she was the daughter of
a free race, and queen of her tribe, he had been proud
of his conquest. He had straightened himself up in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>314]</a></span>
his saddle, like a crowned king, conqueror in many
battles. He had handled his spear with a firmer hand.
He had glanced proudly at the other drovers, his
comrades, with a distinct feeling that he was &ldquo;better
than they,&rdquo; since this savage queen, who, in her travels,
had doubtless seen so many brave and comely men, had
chosen him&mdash;even though he were not the first!&mdash;that
she, whom the laws of her people forbade to love a
European dog, the slave of cities, had chosen him, the
drover of Camargue!</p>

<p>Now that that happiness was gone from him, he suddenly
realized its value. An immense void lay before
him. For the first time, the desert seemed a melancholy
place to him, too vast, too bare. He realized that henceforth
his whole life would lie in the past. He was no
longer the king! He would never be the king again!
She had never loved him! And she had pretended
that she did!</p>

<p>But when she had cried out and turned pale in his
arms, had she not forgotten that she was acting a lie?
If that were so, she must be very sure of finding elsewhere
such ardent caresses as his, from another. Otherwise
she would not have fled, for he scouted the idea
that she was afraid. Such a one as she could have no
fear! And if, as he thought the night before, he had
really taken her fancy, would she not have remained,
guilty or not, to enjoy his caresses anew, even though
she were to die of them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>315]</a></span>
But she would not have died of them! She, sorceress
as she was, must have known that he would have forgiven
everything. Therefore she had <em>wanted</em> to go.
She cared nothing for him. If, on the other hand, it
had pleased her to keep him with her, to continue their
liaison, she would have found a way to do it, in spite
of everything. She had only to desire to do it. She
did not <em>desire</em>!&mdash;Even so, he desired her!</p>

<p>He rode away at headlong speed. He must find her
again. Then they would see! And he circled round
the cabin in the swamp like a hawk, examining all the
clumps of thorn-broom, all the tamarisks and reeds.
Oh! he would find her!</p>

<p>He had been riding for several hours, and he began
to feel that his quest was useless. If she were outside
the limits of the last greater circle that he had described
in his search for her, it was all over! he was too late.</p>

<p>At last, convinced of his discomfiture, he leaped from
his horse and seated himself on the sloping bank of a
ditch. It was near midday. He was neither hungry
nor thirsty, but the sun told him that it was midday.</p>

<p>The gnats were humming about his ears, devouring
him, riddling the hide of his horse, who hung his head
and sniffed at a tuft of salt grass without eating it, pulling
a little upon the rein which Renaud, still seated,
held loosely in his hand.</p>

<p>Renaud was looking straight before him, and now
that he was assured of his misfortune, now that he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>316]</a></span>
neither betrothed nor mistress, neither present nor future,
he felt that he was becoming cold and hard, and was
astonished to find it so. It seemed to him as if his
misfortune had happened to a piece of wood or stone.
The wood and the stone were himself. How could he
have had such dread of the certainty that had come to
him at last? While he had that dread, he still hoped
and suffered. Now that all was said, he found that he
was insensible to it all&mdash;dead, in a measure. And that
gratified him.</p>

<p>He who had wept so bitterly the night that he tried
to put aside his nascent passion, now, in this final catastrophe,
which should have called forth all the tears in
his body, felt as if the springs had run dry. Instead
of being more deeply moved than ever, he found that
he was strangely composed, as if armed against fate.&mdash;He
received the blow like a soldier, like a drover. His
tranquillity became more pronounced and more extraordinary
as the excessive severity of the disaster became
more certain.</p>

<p>Tranquillity for an hour, perhaps! But what did that
matter? He had no suspicion of it. He found that
he was strong in the face of disaster. Ah! she could
make up her mind to go? She was laughing at me?
Very good! I have no need of her, the vagabond! I
have seen through the sorceress! I know her, I know
her! Good-evening!</p>

<p>He rose, to return home. As he raised his head, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>317]</a></span>
saw the gitana&mdash;five hundred yards ahead of him.&mdash;Her
back was turned to him, and she was walking tranquilly
along.</p>

<p>In a twinkling, he was in the saddle. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;
Blanchet, smarting under a blow from the stirrup-leather,
flew over the ground, making the sand and stones fly,
snorting with wrath as the spur tore his flank. In four
minutes they made half a league. The gipsy, still in
front, with her back turned to them, walked quietly
along. It was her orange handkerchief, her copper
crown, her undulating gait. It was certainly she!</p>

<p>Suddenly, when she reached the shore of a pond, she
walked out, with the same tranquil step, upon the surface
of the water, which bore her weight as if it were
covered with ice; while, not far away, a large brig,
decked out with flags, was bearing down upon him,
with all sail set, through the furze-bushes and prickly
oaks of Crau, across the arid fields.</p>

<p>Renaud sadly hung his head. The brig explained it
all. It was all a spectre due to the mirage! Discouragement
came upon the man and crushed him.</p>

<p>Thus, all the strength he had expended, his shameful
acceptance of such a love, his toilsome day of fruitless
search, after the mad ride of the preceding night, the
exhaustion of horse and rider, all came to an end in
the endless trickery of the mirage!</p>

<p>The sorceress must be far away! And in what direction?
There was nothing for him to do but abandon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>318]</a></span>
the pursuit. He retraced his steps to the Icard farm.
The fruitlessness of the effort affected him more keenly
than the effort itself.</p>

<p>He no longer looked about, he no longer thought,
he no longer loved or hated. Weariness had suddenly
fallen upon his shoulders and his loins like a weight too
heavy to be borne. He rode on, bent almost double,
swaying like an inert thing, with the motion of his
horse. He felt as if he were falling from a great height
in a sort of sick man&rsquo;s dream. His eyes, worn out with
gazing over the fields and scrutinizing every bush, closed
in spite of him. His nerveless hand knew not where
the reins were; nor did his brain know what had become
of his ideas.</p>

<p>Blanchet went forward mechanically, with his head
almost touching the ground. He, too, was without will-power,
overdone, exhausted, his eyes injected with blood;
his breath was short and quick, and his flanks beat the
charge.</p>

<p>At another time, the careful horseman, who loved his
beasts, would very quickly have noticed that his horse&rsquo;s
wind was broken, when he felt his sides rise and fall
with that short, hard, jerky breath; but Renaud was
conscious of nothing. There was nothing in his head
but a burning void. He did not even long for shade
or rest. He was suffering from the utter dejection that
follows terrible crises, from the great sorrow caused by
death, from hopeless despair. Overwhelmed as he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>319]</a></span>
by his selfish weariness, if he had been capable of recognizing
any sentiment in his mind, he would have found
there a vague, cowardly feeling of annoyance at having
to enter a sick-chamber, at having to witness the spectacle
of Livette&rsquo;s suffering. He would have liked&mdash;but
he had not the strength to do it&mdash;to dismount from his
horse, to lie down in the fresh air, under a tamarisk, and
sleep there a long, long time; to forget himself, to cease
to see or speak or hear or listen or exist!&mdash;He was like
one walking in his sleep.</p>

<p>Suddenly Blanchet stopped, and began to tremble in
every limb, and, before his rider had come to his senses,
his four legs, planted stiffly like stakes, seemed to be
broken by a single blow, and he fell in a heap.</p>

<p>Renaud awoke, standing on his feet beside his fallen
horse. Blanchet was dying. It was soon over. The
honest creature opened, to an unnatural width, his great
glazed eyes, green as the stagnant water in the swamps,
and filled with that wondering expression which the
infinite mystery of living or of having lived imparts to
the gaze of little children, animals, and dying men; he
straightened out his four legs, trembling like the reeds
in the marshes. A shiver ran over his whole body,
riddled with the stings of a myriad of gnats and great
flies, some of which flew up into the air and settled
down again in the corners of the dim, wide-open eyes.
Then the poor creature became motionless, with an
indefinable something that was alarming and terrible in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>320]</a></span>
his immobility, something that put joy to flight, that
seemed to imply finality. It was death. Blanchet had
ended his humble Camarguese life in the open desert,
in the bright sunlight. Livette&rsquo;s horse was dead in the
service of Renaud&rsquo;s passion for Zinzara!</p>

<p>The faithful beast did not know what had happened;
he did not know the reason of the forced journeys, the
multiplied wounds inflicted by Renaud&rsquo;s spurs, by the
stings of the gadflies, and by Zinzara&rsquo;s pin, buried in
his flesh; he had submitted, without a murmur, to the
destiny that bade him suffer at the hands of those who
might have made life pleasanter for him, and, as he lay
dead, his eyes still expressed his endless amazement at
his failure to understand what was expected of him.</p>

<p>It was all over. He was dead. The affectionate
creature had fallen a victim to the violence and malignity
of human passions. Man had betrayed him for a
woman&rsquo;s sake. And now his graceful form, made for
swift movement, was infinitely sad to see, because the
eye could see clearly all that there was in its immobility
contrary to the purpose for which it was designed&mdash;and
irreparable.</p>

<p>Renaud gazed stupidly at him.&mdash;He saw again, like so
many reproachful words, Blanchet&rsquo;s last look, his short,
rapid breath, the shudder that ran over his bleeding skin.
And, restored to his senses by this unforeseen catastrophe
which awoke a thousand salutary thoughts in his mind,
he felt his heart grow soft. He burst into tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>321]</a></span>
Thus Blanchet served his mistress still by his death.
&ldquo;Everything is of some use,&rdquo; said Sigaud.</p>

<p>Renaud stooped and returned, upon his still warm
nostrils, the kiss he had received from him on the day
of his first despair; then, having removed the saddle and
bridle and concealed them in a safe place, he returned
on foot to the Icard farm, with an intense, affectionate
desire to do his utmost to care for and comfort poor
Livette, for the death of her horse brought him back
to her more quickly than anything else could have
done.</p>

<p>He promised himself that he would return and bury
Blanchet, but he did not have time. The good horse
belonged to the vulture and the eagle.</p>

<p>In the evening of that same day, while Livette, sleeping
soundly, seemed to everybody to be out of danger,&mdash;while
Renaud lay, like a dog, in front of her door,
determined to defend and save her,&mdash;Zinzara arrived at
the Alyscamps at Arles.</p>

<p>There, thinking that Renaud might, with the devil&rsquo;s
assistance, succeed in overtaking her,&mdash;although she
may have had her reasons for thinking that his horse
was not in condition for service at that time,&mdash;she left
her house on wheels, in order that she might not be
taken by surprise therein like a wild beast in its lair,&mdash;not
from fear, but because she was desirous, before all
else, not to see him again. She went to the farther end
of the All&eacute;e des Alyscamps, between the rows of tall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>322]</a></span>
poplars, amid the stone monuments, and lighted a fire
of twigs, to give her light enough to look about and
select a spot where she could sleep comfortably.</p>

<p>She went there late, when the lovers who congregate
there on May evenings, to make love upon the tombs,
had returned to the sleeping city.</p>

<p>Along the whole length of the avenue, between the
tall, straight poplars, run two rows of sarcophagi, some
very high, with massive lids, others low and without
lids, with a few scattered blossoms, sown by the wind,
at the bottom. The dead who once slept there were
sent down to Arles in sealed urns, abandoned to the
current of the Rh&ocirc;ne by the cities farther up the river.
Now flowers are springing from their dust; and their
open tombs are nothing more than beds for vagabonds
and lovers.</p>

<p>By the bright light of her fire, which cast her shadow,
enormously exaggerated, upon the wall of the ruined
chapel, Zinzara selected her couch. She tossed an armful
of grass and leaves upon the bottom of a sarcophagus;
and, while the nightingale, who builds his nest
there every year, was singing for dear life, the strange
creature slept peacefully, with her face to the sky, trusting
in her destiny; and, as a ray of moonlight fell upon
her calm face with its closed eyelids, the sorceress resembled
her black mummy, which concealed and idealized
corruption&mdash;embalmed beneath a golden mask.</p>

<h2><a name="chap24" id="chap24"></a>XXIV<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">IN THE GARGATE</span></h2>


<p>When he received Zinzara&rsquo;s message from the gipsy
child, Rampal, who was still suffering from his fall of
a few days before, did not think of going in person to
surprise Renaud. He did better than that. He went
at once to Livette, and told her of the rendezvous at
the cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your lover, Livette, who defends you so fiercely
against a harmless kiss, is with a woman to-night&mdash;you
ought to be able to guess who she is&mdash;in the Conscript&rsquo;s
Hut, near the Icard farm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Livette stood aghast, with pale cheeks, he continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father has good horses; if you want to see
for yourself, you can. It will be worth your while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Rampal,&rdquo; said Livette.</p>

<p>Not for an instant did she doubt the truth of what
he told her, and she said to her father:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go with me to the Icard farm, father, as you know
the people there. Let us go to the Icard farm at once;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>324]</a></span>
my happiness depends on it. There is something there
that I want to see to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor man did not understand, but he always
yielded to her caprice. They set out at once for the
Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon.</p>

<p>They left the wagon at the ch&acirc;teau; they harnessed
the best pair of horses to the cabriolet, and made seven
or eight leagues without stopping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, father. I must be here to-morrow morning.
I will tell you why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was eleven o&rsquo;clock at night.</p>

<p>When all were in bed, Livette, being familiar with &ldquo;the
place,&rdquo; which her father had pointed out to her anew at
her request,&mdash;Livette furtively left the house to prowl
about the spot where disaster awaited her, for love knows
no obstacles, and we follow our destiny through everything,
and rush on to death in pursuit of our last sorrow.</p>

<p>And then?&mdash;Ah! throughout the visions of her sick-bed
Livette constantly lived over that terrible moment
when she was prowling around the swamp. In truth,
she was still there, in agony of mind.</p>

<p>About the swamp, in the darkness, Livette hovered
like a sea-gull in distress. Like a lost soul from hell
she flitted about the edges of the bog, trying to pierce
with her gaze the dark clumps of reeds and tamarisks.</p>

<p>From time to time, according to the spot from which
she looked, she could see the gray roof of the cabin,
silvered by the moonlight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>325]</a></span>
Was any one there? Had Rampal told her the truth?
Ought she to lose this opportunity of convincing herself
with her own eyes of Renaud&rsquo;s treachery?</p>

<p>Should she give her life to a traitor without endeavoring
to unmask him, although warned? With her
widely dilated eyes, she imagined that she saw lights
that did not exist; or&mdash;if she did really see a feeble
gleam through the chinks in the door&mdash;she refused to
believe her eyes.</p>

<p>The blood was tingling in her ears, and she thought
she could hear voices. It seemed to her at times as if
her head were bursting. She could see, inside her head,
beneath her skull, a great white light, and in the centre
of the light Renaud and the gipsy together. Oh! to
think of not finding out!</p>

<p>And, if it should be so, what should she do?</p>

<p>The essential thing was to find out. Afterward, she
would see. If she were strong enough, if she could
do it&mdash;she would certainly kill the woman.&mdash;How?
Livette did not know. Simply with a look, perhaps.&mdash;Madness
rises from the swamps with the miasmatic exhalations
at night. Livette felt that she was going
mad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you get to the cabin?&rdquo; she had asked her
father.</p>

<p>Ah! yes, the path is marked by stakes, is it not? To
the left of the stakes is the path. She cannot see the
tops of the stakes in the dark water. Frogs were sitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>326]</a></span>
on them, perhaps, to look at the moon; or turtles on
those that were just level with the surface. But no, it
was grass that covered them all. And Livette&rsquo;s eyes
ached with her endeavors to open them wider in the
darkness, and find some sign upon the indistinct objects
about her.</p>

<p>But suppose Rampal had deceived her?</p>

<p>At one time, it seemed to her that she could hear
something resembling the gipsy music that made the
snakes dance&mdash;but so weak! Surely it was in her poor,
tired head,&mdash;for if it had been the real music, all the
reptiles in the swamp would have come out to dance, all
at once, in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Bah! Why should she be afraid? As if there were
so very many of the creatures in the country! They
are not fond of the salt in the bogs, nor the high winds.</p>

<p>She hovered about the swamp like a sea-gull lost at
sea!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, this is the way, here is the path under the
water and the stakes that mark it! I must keep the
stakes at my right as I walk along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She starts to take the first step, and dares not&mdash;but
suddenly the sound of voices comes to her ears. She
distinguishes two voices&mdash;two!&mdash;beyond any question.
And now it is surely the metallic sound of the tambourine
that floats through the reeds in the moonlight,
bringing to her heart the frightful vision of the other&rsquo;s
joy!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>327]</a></span>
She will go. After all, since her unhappiness is
certain, what matter if she die of it! Ah! how bitter
would be his punishment if, on coming out, at daybreak,
he should find her there, drowned!</p>

<p>She makes a step; she sinks! but she does not cry out.
No, she will extricate herself unaided&mdash;she must. She
clings to the long grass, to the reeds which break in her
hands. She is sinking! Ah! God! is she to die there?
They would be too well pleased, aye, both of them, to
have caused her death! Therefore she must not die!
She will not! She struggles, and sinks deeper. As she
lifts one foot, she rests her weight on the other, which
goes down, down, and the ooze gains upon her. It rises
to her waist; and still she cannot refrain from raising
her feet, one after the other, as if to climb an imaginary
stairway, the solid ladder that she dreams of but cannot
find!</p>

<p>With every upward effort she sinks lower; it is horrible.
Her hands are so small that she does not grasp
enough grass, enough reeds, at once! Everything about
her yields, everything fails to give support. How the
reeds break between her fingers! like grass threads! It
seems to her that clammy creatures are rubbing against
her legs, her hands&mdash;ah! yes, the snakes&mdash;the bloodsuckers!
She will be eaten alive by the bloodsuckers.&mdash;But
where is the stake, near the edge of the swamp, that
she thought she saw a moment ago? She lets go the
grass to which she is clinging, with the result that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>328]</a></span>
sinks deeper, still deeper. Now the cold water submerges
her bosom, surrounds her neck, crawls up toward
her mouth. Will she be compelled in a moment to
drink that filthy water? At that thought, she makes one
final effort. Her dishevelled locks cling about her neck,
as if to strangle her, all drenched and cold and slimy,
like veritable snakes!&mdash;She struggles, tosses her hands
about this way and that&mdash;until one of them comes in
contact with the wooden stake, firmly planted in the
ground.&mdash;Saintes Maries!&mdash;She seizes it, twines her fingers
about it, digs her nails into it, and does not relax
her hold. Nor will she, even when she is dead! But her
arm no longer has the strength to raise her, and her head
falls heavily back&mdash;her eyes close. Is this death?&mdash;It
was at that moment, just as she lost consciousness, that
the brave-hearted maid cried out,&mdash;not until then. And
her cry rang out over the swamps, like the call of the
birds of passage, which ceaselessly, over all the waters
upon earth, seek the repose that can never be found.</p>

<p>That ghastly vision recurred again and again to
Livette, while the women of the Icard farm were busying
themselves, a little too noisily, around her bed. At
last, there was silence in her room. She saw her father
come in, but she did not choose to explain anything
to him. She sent word to the grandmother not to be
anxious, that she would return home in three days.
Livette asked to see Renaud. Her father went to find
him. She closed her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>329]</a></span>
She fancied that she could remember, now, certain
things that happened to her during her sleep of death
in the <i>gargate</i>, but were not reproduced in her dream.
She felt Renaud&rsquo;s arms lifting her out of the mire, and
that, after all, is the one thing to be desired, more than
life itself&mdash;the protection of the man she loved, her
lover&rsquo;s mourning for her, thinking that she was dead.&mdash;But
before that, a moment before, had she not felt the
weight of a fixed gaze upon her?&mdash;She had looked dimly
forth between her drooping eyelids, through her long
lashes which seemed to her like a thick grating; and
she fancied that she saw the gipsy, the ill-omened gitana,
standing before her. &ldquo;Yes, it is she, it is really she.
She is standing here beside me. She looks very, very
tall. Her head touches the sky. She is on the path
leading to the cabin. She is just coming from the rendezvous.
She has been kissing Renaud! When will
he come? Will the witch&rsquo;s black shadow, standing so
straight there, never go? What more do you want,
witch? Don&rsquo;t you see that I am dead? I must make
you think I am dead. Then you will leave me, at
last!&mdash;The wicked woman is always smiling. Ah! there
she goes.&mdash;How heavy her glance was! And how tall
she was! She kept all the light from me. Now I can
see the sky again. Is it you, Renaud, is it you, Jacques,
who take me in your arms as if I were dead?&mdash;It is you,
at last!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus cried poor Livette, delirious once more. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>330]</a></span>
Renaud was sitting beside her bed with his face in his
hands, listening to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is you,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;you think me dead, and
I can feel you take me in your arms and quickly carry
me away. But why do you not weep, when you see me
so? It is you, at last! I am dead, and still I feel
you. You have me in your arms. Your heart beats
fast. Mine has ceased to beat. Where were you, bad
boy? What did you say to her? But that is past and
gone!&mdash;Is that woman very dear to your heart?&mdash;Why
do you come no more to my father&rsquo;s house in the evening?
He is very fond of you. Grandma is a dear
old soul. Do you see how faithful she is to her dead
husband? People knew how to love one another better
in her day, she says. Is it true? Do you believe it,
Jacques? And if I die, won&rsquo;t you keep my memory
sacred, as she keeps grandpa&rsquo;s?&mdash;Why do you make me
suffer so?&mdash;Are we two never to walk under the great
elm again? Our pretty stone bench under the rose-bushes
is very sad now, and lonely like a tombstone.
Ah! if you had chosen! I was pretty, yes, pretty,
pretty! And now I shall be ugly. For I have done
with life, even if I am not dead. My life is at an end,
at an end!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap25" id="chap25"></a>XXV<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE PHANTOM</span></h2>


<p>Livette, who had been carried back to the Ch&acirc;teau
d&rsquo;Avignon many days before, had not left her bed. The
fever clung to her obstinately. Nothing could be done.</p>

<p>Was it really true, O God, that she was doomed to
die, and he to see it? Was he to lose the future he had
dreamed of, a future of unruffled happiness, of love and
peace, as her husband; the joy he had known for such
a brief space, of having a woman, sweet and dear and
helpless as a child, to cherish and protect?&mdash;Was he
condemned never to know the pleasure of having a
family&mdash;a pleasure that had been denied to him, an
orphan, and of which he had often dreamed as of one
of the joys of Paradise&mdash;was he condemned never to
know it, because he had forgotten his longing for a
single day? The picture, dear to country-folk, of the
chimney with the smoke curling upward, that seems to
say to them, as far as it can be seen: &ldquo;The soup is hot,
the wife is waiting, the children are calling,&rdquo; recurred
sometimes to his mind, and he sighed profoundly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>332]</a></span>
The punishment that he saw coming upon him did
not seem to him proportionate to the offence. There
was no justice in it!</p>

<p>What is the meaning of that most terrible of all mysteries:
that the love of the senses is more powerful
than the love of the heart when separated from its
object, even though the last be recognized as the more
certain and the sweeter?</p>

<p>Between the lofty chapel and the subterranean crypt
of the church of Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, on the level
of human life, does the miracle come always from below?
And if it be so, is it any less a miracle? Which of
you has fathomed the meaning of life? Who can say:
&ldquo;It is unjust,&rdquo; or: &ldquo;It is useless,&rdquo; or: &ldquo;What I do
not see does not exist&rdquo;? Who can say if Livette&rsquo;s
sufferings and Renaud&rsquo;s, their troubles and their heart-burnings,
all the invisible and inexplicable movements
within themselves,&mdash;of which they knew nothing,&mdash;were
not preparing the way for realities inconceivable to our
minds? The <em>ideal</em>, the dream of what is best, is the
essential condition of the <em>material</em> development of mankind.
No force is wasted; everything is transformed.
&ldquo;Everything is of some use,&rdquo; said the old shepherd
Sigaud. &ldquo;It takes all kinds to make a world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Livette had forgiven Renaud, Renaud had not forgiven
himself.</p>

<p>Sometimes he gazed at her, deeply moved, and he
suffered with her for hours at a time. Sometimes he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>333]</a></span>
sudden fits of rage against her&mdash;paroxysms of wickedness,
as it were. Was she not an obstacle in his path? At
such times, he believed that he was possessed by a devil,
and he would kneel by Livette&rsquo;s bed and pray to the
saints, the women of compassion.</p>

<p>Ah! how thin she was! Her eyes seemed to have
grown larger, and to have changed from blue to black,
because the pupils were still dilated. Her long, fair hair
no longer shone. It seemed as if the muddy water of
the swamp had taken away its gloss forever.</p>

<p>She often started at noises that she imagined she heard.</p>

<p>She, who in the old days used to talk but little, was
constantly telling of the things she had dreamed, and
she would be vexed if they were not remembered.</p>

<p>The doctors of Arles tried everything. Nothing was
of any avail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want no more of their medicine,&rdquo; she said one
day to Renaud. &ldquo;They might do very well for swamp
fever, but there is something else the matter with me.
It was my heart that you drowned. I never could believe
you again; it is much better that I should die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had explained nothing to her father or grandmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They would have turned you out of the house,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and I wanted to see you to the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her journey to the Icard farm, her nocturnal flight,
her accident, all were attributed to an attack of fever,
which was supposed to have been responsible for her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>334]</a></span>
actions, whereas, on the contrary, her illness was the
result of them all.</p>

<p>Renaud, by a desperate effort, mastered his passion at
last. Was it forever? He chose to think so, because it
was necessary that it should be so, in order to keep her
alive.</p>

<p>He tried not to think of the other. He tried to
repent. Every moment he tore from his mind by an
exertion of his will&mdash;as he would tear up grass with his
hand&mdash;some one of his memories. He told amusing
stories, pretending to laugh loudest at them.</p>

<p>His heart was filled with a great pity for Livette, but,
for all that, you would not have had to lift a very large
stone to find there, in a spot that he knew well, the
sleeping viper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall die, I shall die!&rdquo;&mdash;Livette often said, &ldquo;but I
want to see the f&ecirc;te of Saintes-Maries once more. I want
to live till then. You must carry me there and lay me
on the relics; that is where I want to die. And at my
burial, I want the drovers, your comrades, to follow on
horseback&mdash;promise me this&mdash;with their spears reversed,
like the soldiers I saw at Avignon one day, marching to
the cemetery, holding their guns that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a sort of gaiety, she often recurred to the subject
of her burial, and embellished it with other details,
saying, with the air of a playful child:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be lilies, as there are in the procession
at Saintes-Maries when they go to bless the sea; I want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>335]</a></span>
lots of lilies! Lilies are so pretty and white! they are
so proud on their stalks, and they smell so sweet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the season was hastening away; the
months came and went, like the same months in years
past for centuries.</p>

<p>Summer set the sky and land and sea ablaze, drawing
the last drop of moisture from the swamps, sowing the
venomous seeds of miasma in the heavy air that people
breathed. The crops ripened; then came the harvest.
It was autumn. The redbreast sang in the park of the
Ch&acirc;teau d&rsquo;Avignon. The nights grew long once more.
The leaves fell. The sad days of the year began.</p>

<p>The buttercups had disappeared. The Vaccar&egrave;s, which
had been dry all summer, no longer exposed to the sun
its lovely mouse-gray bed; it was once more a sea. The
light golden tint of the September sky was long since
hidden from sight behind the rising mists.</p>

<p>The birds of passage began anew their flight over the
mirror-like island which promised them abundant prey.
The eagle hurried from the Alps to make war upon the
fish-hawks. And at night, when the wind howled and
the rain fell in torrents, the storks and cranes and geese
passed over in triangular flocks, at a great height in the
drenched atmosphere, uttering cries like cries of alarm.</p>

<p>Livette&rsquo;s suffering became more intense. She passed
whole days sitting at her window.</p>

<p>One evening, Renaud was sitting beside her, in silence,
while the grandmother and P&egrave;re Audiffret were dining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>336]</a></span>
in the room below. The room was dimly lighted by a
lamp. Suddenly Livette sprang to her feet, then fell
back, crying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There she is! there she is! No! no! don&rsquo;t go with
her! I don&rsquo;t want you to! no, no, Jacques!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Renaud also had risen, and was staring vacantly at
Livette; following the direction of her gaze, he began to
tremble. Outside the window stood a pale, uncertain,
but very recognizable spectre, the gipsy herself! He had
no sooner recognized her than she disappeared, after
making a significant sign to him, that said: &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not a vision of the sick girl&rsquo;s imagination, for
he, too, had seen it!</p>

<p>Perhaps the fever-laden island had sown its poison in
the blood of both. The germs of fever were taking
root and flourishing in them. The blight of the <i>paluns</i>
implanted in their brains, as in a cloudy mirror, the
image everlastingly repeated of the familiar plaintive
objects of the desert, with which the current of their
thoughts was mingled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go! don&rsquo;t go! my Jacques!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She dragged herself along the floor on her knees,
shaken with sobs, imploring the drover, as she clung
with both hands to his jacket.</p>

<p>The father and grandmother had hastened to the room.</p>

<p>The father, too, was sobbing, and knew not what to
do. The grandmother slowly seated herself by the bed
on which Renaud had gently laid Livette.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>337]</a></span>
Calm and silent, the old woman gazed long and with
a beautiful expression of perfect trust upon the copper
crucifix and the images of the saints that hung on the
wall of the recess.</p>

<p>And, on the bed, Livette, uttering cries like a lost
bird, twining her fingers about her as if clinging to life,
to the reeds in the swamp wherein she still fancied that
she was drowning&mdash;Livette breathed her last.</p>

<p>Livette was dead.</p>

<p>The drovers, on horseback, with spears reversed, attended
her body to the cemetery. Her favorite dog
followed her thither.</p>

<p>Renaud placed lilies on her grave. She sleeps in the
cemetery of Saintes-Maries, at the foot of the dunes,
under the cultivated lilies, among the wild asphodels,
on the sea-shore.</p>

<p>Renaud returned to the desert, too much like the bull
that, when wounded in the arena, returns to the solitude
of the swamps, where he can lick his wounds, give free
vent to his rage, bellow at the clouds, and to no purpose,
but to his heart&rsquo;s content tear at the steel left
in the wound.</p>

<p>One day they found, on the shore of the Vaccar&egrave;s,
Rampal&rsquo;s bleeding body, pierced by horns in two places.
Bernard alone saw his duel with Renaud one evening,
when the sky was red with the afterglow. They fought
hand to hand, in the midst of the drove, and Renaud,
lifting his enemy from the ground in his arms, laid him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>338]</a></span>
face upward, dead, on the horns of a heifer that came
rushing at them and, with one motion of her bulky
head, tossed a corpse into the air.</p>

<p>Rampal died without a cry. He lay three days where
he fell. The black bulls, that mourn nine days when
one of their kind falls dead in the pasture, bellowed
for three days around Rampal&rsquo;s body, at a respectful
distance.</p>

<p>Bernard alone saw the duel and said nothing; but the
people of the desert knew; they guessed the truth.</p>

<p>Since that, Renaud has become like a phantom himself.</p>

<p>In all weathers, summer or winter, rain or shine, he
can be seen here and there, in the Camargue desert,
sitting erect and melancholy on his horse, spear in
hand.</p>

<p>He regrets Livette. He loves Zinzara. He weeps only
for himself, the wretched creature! He has lost the
paradise of affection he had dreamed of, and the appetizing
hell of savage love he had tasted. He has nothing.
It seems to him that Livette&rsquo;s death, for which he blames
himself, has left him free to abandon himself to his
passion for the other; but the other is absent&mdash;and,
though absent, she tortures him as relentlessly as on the
day when, clinging to his horse&rsquo;s mane, she defied him
with insulting words, and aroused his passions, while he
dared not shake her off, trample upon her, or seize her.</p>

<p>The memory of her is upon him like the gadfly that
persists in following back the bloody track of its sting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>339]</a></span>
Vainly does he shake himself; he cannot rid himself
of it. Renaud loves Zinzara; he longs for her without
hope, and, ruled by that single desire, he feels no other,
so that the unexpended power of his youth accumulates
within him and drives him mad.</p>

<p>The friends&rsquo; houses, the f&ecirc;tes he used formerly to
visit, have no further interest for him, because the only
being he seeks cannot be found. The desert, once
peopled with hopes in his eyes, has become an empty
void. The roads that traverse it no longer lead anywhere.</p>

<p>He surprises himself sometimes, at night, bellowing
with the bulls, against the wind that annoys them, toward
the distant horizon. He is like one possessed. A devil
dwells within him.</p>

<p>When he is weary of wandering about and of being
in the saddle, and chooses to lie down and sleep for a
day, he repairs to the cabin of his love, in the <i>gargate</i>,
and there, full sure of being undisturbed, raves like a
wild beast, in his frenzy at being alone. In the morning,
he emerges from his retreat, more depressed, more
miserable, more haunted with visions than ever.</p>

<p>At times, he fancies that he sees Livette under his
horse&rsquo;s feet, imploring wildly, with hands outstretched&mdash;but
he digs his spurs into his horse and rides on. A
terrible shriek constantly rings in his ears.</p>

<p>He rides toward another spectre that calls him from
the farthest point of the horizon.&mdash;He says, to any one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>340]</a></span>
who cares to listen, that he has come from Egypt, where
he was a king, and that he will return there some day,
King of Camargue.</p>

<p>His disordered mind seems the very incarnation of the
wild moor. He fancies that he is flying about in circles
with the birds of the swamps that weep in the drizzling
rain. The <i>mistral</i> lashes his wings. When the wind
blows through his hair, he pities the poor grass of the
plains because the <i>mistral</i> is torturing it.</p>

<p>All the lamentations of the reeds and swamps, of
the river and the sea, are but the ringing in his ears,
and their loud wailing is constantly punctuated by
a shriek&mdash;oh! so heart-rending it is!&mdash;the shriek of
Livette!</p>

<p>As the bell-tower of the church of Saintes-Maries is
filled with owls, so his heart is full of the remorse of a
Christian; and the cur&eacute;&rsquo;s kindness to him does not drive
it away.</p>

<p>When he stands upon the sea-shore, many times he
feels an overpowering desire to urge his horse, bleeding
beneath the spur, far out to sea, farther and farther, until
he vanishes in the direction of the country, vaguely seen
in dreams, from which the saints and gipsies come&mdash;but
something stops him; his destiny holds him back; he
belongs to his kingdom.</p>

<p>If he has known one hour&rsquo;s peace of mind, it was on
a certain morning when, among the usual hideous nightmares
inspired by the memory of Zinzara, he had a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>341]</a></span>
pleasant dream, in which he saw Livette, dressed in
white, with lilies in her hands like the saints in church
pictures, smiling and saying to him: &ldquo;I have forgiven
you. <span class="smcap">Forgive yourself.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The respite was of brief duration, for the herdsman
did not know that excessive repentance is a crime, when
it goes so far as to dry up the springs of will-power in a
man, when it renders sterile his field of activity, when it
bars the way to doing better in the future.</p>

<p>Self-pardon, at the proper time, after due penance has
been done, is one of the secrets of the wise among men;
for, without it, the first misstep would lead to never-ending
despair, and would render all courage useless
forever.</p>

<p>Such was the cur&eacute;&rsquo;s opinion, which Renaud listened
to, in the confessional, without paying heed to it.</p>

<p>He suffers, therefore, incessantly, awaiting the hour
when his suffering shall be allayed. He is like the
camping-grounds abandoned by shepherds and flocks,
the <i>jasses</i> of the desert, still black from an old conflagration,
and surrounded by briers where rose-bushes
once flourished. He is like the aloes that wither instantly
in desolation, after the stalk their love has caused
to bloom has risen high into the air.</p>

<p>The dream in which Renaud saw Livette was explained
to him several times by Monsieur le cur&eacute;, but
always to no purpose.</p>

<p>How, indeed, could his remorse cease, when his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>342]</a></span>
passion still endured, and when he was constantly committing
anew, in desire, the sin that caused all the
misery?</p>

<p>My friends, there is but one wise course to pursue:
&ldquo;Plant a tree, build a house, rear a child. Be patient&mdash;everything
comes in due time. The thing that does not
happen in a hundred years, may happen in six thousand.
The future is still yours!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Renaud, in the dreams of his unhealthy life,
feels, as he sometimes does, that his love is stronger in
him than his passion, it seems to him as if Livette were
drawing him toward death, but truthful, kindly beings
never inspire thoughts of self-destruction.</p>

<p>Of one thing, at least, he is certain. He feels that
voluntary death would not remove him from the circle
of the accursed. He would, on the contrary, descend
still lower in the spiral pit of mortals damned by love.</p>

<p>They say that persons drowned in the Rh&ocirc;ne, borne
along without doubt by the irresistible current, which
brings them all together at the mouth of the river,
return, on certain evenings, to hold a carnival of despair
on the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Happy are they since they are, on those occasions,
united.</p>

<p>But they who are drowned in stagnant waters, and
they who, to join them, die by their own hand, are
never aught but solitary spectres. They seek each other
all the time, but always unavailingly. They are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>343]</a></span>
souls of the damned. They wander through the desert,
calling to one another; but never even approach or see
one another; and at night, in the deserts of Crau and
Camargue, the traveller hears long-drawn, wailing cries,
flying unavailingly hither and thither over the vast
plains, forever and forever.</p>

<p>Even the clouds call and answer one another in their
aerial flight.</p>

What would the good cur&eacute; have said had he been told that a
contemporary poet, Monsieur Pierre Gauthiez, has adopted the too
common error? According to him, an Egyptian Marie came to
Camargue in the boat with the saints.&mdash;When they approached the
shore, it became necessary to reward the devoted boatman who had
helped them to accomplish the prodigious journey. One of them
gave him a sprig of rosemary that had touched the lips of the
Christ; another, a lock of her fair hair. And as to the third&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Egyptian of the soft dark eye, standing beside an olive-tree,
gazed upon the comely boatman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She put aside her linen veil and discovered her virgin flesh, all
pure and glistening, like a wax taper, beneath the setting sun. She
was quite naked, and, as the young man knelt on the red sand, with
lips on fire, holding out his arms to her as if to God, the saint, like the
stars in heaven, wearing no gown or veil, said to him: &lsquo;Thou seest,
my boatman, I have naught but Myself wherewith to pay thee!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

The <i>tarasque</i>, perhaps, is nothing more than a reproduction of
the crocodile of the Rh&ocirc;ne, increased in size to an absurd degree
by the popular imagination. This one, the last that was seen in
Camargue, so they say, is hanging to-day in the <i>H&ocirc;pital des Antiquailles</i>
at Lyon, with an inscription stating the source from whence
it came: &ldquo;Gift of M. le Cur&eacute; of Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer.&rdquo;</p>
